# ü™ê Prodigy / spaCy / wandb pipeline based on ü™ê spaCy Projects
## Use Case 01 NER BBC & NG news
+ Annotation process via Prodigy annotation tool
+ Weights & Biases for logging of training experiments


NER project for spaCy v3. The project data comes from kaggle: 
+ BBC (https://www.kaggle.com/hgultekin/bbcnewsarchive)
+ NG (https://www.kaggle.com/salmaelanigri/doc-class)

Label scheme (2 labels for 2 components):

| Component | Labels |
| --- | --- |
| **`NER`** | `PERSON`|
| **`ENTITY_RULER`** | `EMAIL` |

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows.

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data-to-spacy` | Merge your annotations and create data in spaCy's binary format |
| `train_spacy` | Train a named entity recognition model with spaCy and log the results via wandb |
| `train_prodigy` | Train a named entity recognition model with Prodigy |
| `train_curve` | Train the model with Prodigy by using different portions of training examples to evaluate if more annotations can potentially improve the performance |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the model and export metrics via spaCy |
| `visualize-model` | Visualize the model's output interactively using Streamlit |
| `visualize-data` | Visualize the data interactively using Streamlit |
| `package` | Package the trained model so it can be installed |


### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` |  `data-to-spacy` &rarr; `train_spacy` &rarr; `evaluate` |
| `all_prodigy` | `train_prodigy` &rarr; `train_curve` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following raw assets are defined by the project.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/raw/UC1_train_meta.jsonl` | Local | JSONL-formatted raw training data (1778 docs) |
| `assets/raw/UC1_eval_meta.jsonl` | Local | JSONL-formatted raw development data (593 docs) |

{"text":" A US airline attendant suspended over \"inappropriate images\" on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired.  Ellen Simonetti, known as Queen of the Sky, wrote an anonymous semi-fictional account of her life in the sky. She was suspended by Delta in September. In a statement, she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for \"wrongful termination\". A Delta spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that Ms Simonetti was no longer an employee. Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls \"internal employee matters\". A spokesperson reiterated this position on Wednesday, confirming only that Ms Simonetti was no longer with the company. The spokesperson also confirmed that there were \"very clear rules\" attached to the unauthorised use of Delta branding, including uniforms. Ms Simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 November.  She said in an official statement: \"As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by Delta Airlines I am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the Federal Government EEOC [US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].\" She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for \"wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages.\" Ms Simonetti told the BBC News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September. Queen of the Sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the BBC News website and others.  Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. The blog, which she started in January as a way of getting over her mother's death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts. Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti. In the postings, she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity. But some postings contained images of herself in uniform. Of the 10 or so images only one showed Ms Simonetti's flight \"wings\". She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. \"I never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them,\" Ms Simonetti said. A legal expert in the US speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted.  Delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition. It has said it needs to cut between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (\u00a32.7bn) a year. Analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention. Last week, it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy. The deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million Delta shares, unions said. And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007. The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express.

{"text":" Comic book veteran Stan Lee is to team up with producer Robert Evans to create a movie featuring a new superhero.  Foreverman will focus on a character who has to face problems in everyday life as well as using his special powers to save the world. Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films. Lee is best known for his work on Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.  He is collaborating on the script with screenwriter Peter Briggs, who penned the recent comic book adaptation Hellboy. \"We believe it to be truly a whole new franchise,\" said Gill Champion, president and chief executive of Lee's POW! Entertainment. \"In this world where people are looking for something different, Stan's idea was to create a concept not seen before to become an evergreen franchise for Paramount.\" Many of Lee's other creations, including X-Men and Daredevil, have been turned into films in the past five years. However, the Spider-Man series has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (\u00a3857m) worldwide. A third Spider-Man film is scheduled for release in 2007. Another Marvel Comics adaptation, The Fantastic Four, will be released in cinemas this summer. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Have you considered Josephus, the Jewish Historian,\n>        who also wrote of Jesus?  In addition, the four gospel accounts\n>        are very much in harmony.  \n\nBill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \ncontain the first four.  \n\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\n\nIts faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. \nWhatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others. \n\nRegards,\n\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" French actress Audrey Tautou, star of hit film Amelie, will play the female lead in the film adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, it has been reported.  The movie version of Dan Brown's best-selling novel is being directed by Ron Howard and also stars Tom Hanks. Tautou will play Hanks' code-cracking partner, according to various newspapers. She is currently starring in A Very Long Engagement, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet was also responsible for directing Tautou in Amelie in 2001, which launched the actress into the mainstream.  She also starred as the lead role in critically-acclaimed film Dirty Pretty Things in 2002. Oscar-winning director Ron Howard chose Tautou for the part, preferring a French actress to a big name Hollywood star. UK actress Kate Beckinsale had been widely tipped as a possibility for the role alongside Vanessa Paradis and Juliette Binoche. The thriller upon which the movie is based has sold more than 17 million copies and is centred on a global conspiracy surrounding the Holy Grail mythology. The Louvre Museum, scene of the gruesome murder at the beginning of the novel, recently gave permission for filming to take place there, showbusiness newspaper Variety reported. The $100m movie will be produced by Columbia\/Sony Pictures and is due for release on May 19, 2006 in the United States and France. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Liverpool and Millwall have been charged by the Football Association over crowd trouble during their Carling Cup match on 26 October.  Millwall, who lost the match 3-0, have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters. During the match at Millwall's new Den Stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. A disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. Liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the Hillsborough disaster, where 96 supporters were crushed to death in April 1989. But Lions chairman Theo Paphitis has denied the claims. He has said CCTV footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a Liverpool fan attacking a Millwall fan in the west stand. However, Millwall have been charged with two breaches of FA rules. They have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and\/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch. Liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and\/or violent and\/or provocative behaviour. Both clubs have until 23 December to respond. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" A new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota.  The company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like \"i-unit\" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.  Also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped \"i-foot\". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.  Standing at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km\/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. \"They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production,\" said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. \"They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. \"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace.\"  The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyota's prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual's particular mobility needs. While Toyota's prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.  Experts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.  \"Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people,\" Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. \"You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.\" Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: \"The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. \"For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. \"It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered,\" said Dr Avineri. \"In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. \"This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.\" Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. \"The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,\" said Dr Gillingwater. \"What's their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. \"Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Did you ever read newspaper at all?\n\n\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12\/6\/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

{"text":" US actor Ossie Davis has been found dead at the age of 87.  Davis, who was married to actress Ruby Dee, was found dead on Friday in his hotel room in Miami Beach, Florida, where he was making a film. Davis, whose 65-year career included credits as a producer, director, actor and writer for stage and screen, was also a civil rights activist. Miami Beach police spokesman Bobby Hernandez said the cause of death appeared to be natural.  Davis's body was discovered by his grandson and paramedics at the Shore Club hotel in Miami Beach, where the actor had been shooting the film Retirement. Mr Hernandez said: \"After gaining entry, they found Mr Davis had passed away. \"The cause of death appears to be natural. According to his grandson he was suffering from heart disease.\" Some of Davis's best known roles included The Joe Louis Story and Gone Are the Days - a film he adapted from his own play, Purlie Victorious. He also appeared in 7 Spike Lee movies, including School Daze, Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever.  His film debut, in 1950, was in the film No Way Out, starring Sydney Poitier and Ruby Dee. Davis and Dee were married for more than 56 years and together received Kennedy Center honours in 2004 for their body of work. The Actors' Equity Association issued a statement calling Davis \"an icon in the American theatre\" and he and Dee \"American treasures\". Davis was also a prominent figure in the civil rights movement and was a voice for racial equality. He was a featured speaker at the funerals of both Martin Luther King Jnr and Malcolm X. Besides Dee, Davis is survived by three children Nora, Hasna and Guy, a blues artist, and seven grandchildren. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

What I have seen from the March Beta is\nthat it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user\nfeatures. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow\ntwo users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user\nper console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. \n\nI believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third\nparty. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the\nnet. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like\ncsh on Unix for remote logins. \n\nIn general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to\nWin3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being\nslow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems\nalso start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was\nright when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing\naround with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using\na \"business computer\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I\nwould consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much\ncheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides\nthe robustness such an application requires. \n\nOn the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget\nabout NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats\nthe purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a\nnetworked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your\nmachine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32\nbased Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.\nI expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32\nbecomes widely available. \n\n--\nSadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computing\ne-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

Virginia Madsen was also named best supporting actress for her performance in the film. House of Flying Daggers, directed by Yimou Zhang, was named best foreign language film, while the animation award went to The Incredibles. Unusually, the runners-up in categories were also named with Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby just missing out on the best film award.

{"text":" Black Sabbath have topped a list of the best British rock albums of all time.  The band once fronted by Ozzy Osbourne led a poll of Kerrang! magazine readers with their 1970 self-titled debut. The band have three more efforts on the list, including fifth-placed Paranoid. Osbourne appears more than any other act, with two solo records featured. The top five includes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden and Sex Pistols. Queen, Muse, Manic Street Preachers and The Clash complete the top 10. A mix of heavy metal, punk, glam rock and even dance music makes up the list. Motorhead, Judas Priest and Prodigy are included along with newer acts like The Darkness and Lostprophets.  Kerrang! editor Ashley Bird said: \"It's amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene. \"These are the real opinions of proper rock fans.\"  Formed by four teenage friends in the West Midlands in the late 1960s, Black Sabbath are one of Britain's most successful heavy rock bands. Their debut was a UK top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the US. Osbourne said the band's success in the Kerrang! poll was a triumph for British rock. He said: \"Back then you'd hear: 'If you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. \"We lived in Aston, Birmingham. The only flowers I ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery.\" Despite being disliked by many critics, Black Sabbath's subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to Osbourne leaving in 1979. The band continued without Osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide. He was eventually cleared of the charges. Osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the Live Aid charity concert in 1985. After many changes in line-up, the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997. Black Sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while Osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through MTV documentary series The Osbournes. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots.  Hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: \"We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.\" \"We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.\" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m\/h. Its \"wheel feet\" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. \"I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,\" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be \"trained\" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.  Robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.  Sony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was \"born\" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km\/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million \"entertainment and leisure\" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the \nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \nsites?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three \nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\n\t     \n\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \nthey have troops on the ground there.\n\t     \n\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \nthink we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a \npolicy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I follow up?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \nto stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.\n\t     \n\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making \nprogress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and \nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \nthe region.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the \nsituation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I \ndon't know that the administration could have made it different.\n\t     \n\t     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the \nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies \nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \nin only a decade.  \n\t     \n\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \nThat's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \nare moving in the right direction economically.\n\t     \n\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \ndidn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \nThere are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I \njust disagree with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been \nunderway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \nargument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates \nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \nforward.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just \nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \nbasically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days \nwith regard to the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Waco --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have \nmuch to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \ninsights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole \nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry \nthat they killed their children.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \nPerot said today that you're playing games with the American people \nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \npackage.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \nresubmit them to the Hill?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \nWe're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going \nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \nthat rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. \nPerot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a \nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if \nmaybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and \nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \npolitical criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you \nthink you can sit back and just --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's \nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's \ngot some constructive ideas.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the American people have shown that they're very \nimpatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one \nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \neven if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my \njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will \nchange people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \ndebate and not just to the President.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \nunilaterally?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \nmandate of the United Nations.\n\n\t     Q\t  But you have a mandate and --\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \nthat we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for \naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \nWe are not.  \n\n\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \nwe have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French \nand others about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would that be military action?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in \nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \ngrip?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's \nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \nthese are things you said that you didn't support.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we \nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \nqualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \ndon't know exactly what he said.\n\t     \n\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss \nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going \nto do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies \nspeaking out of school.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's \na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had \na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a \nline against an administration policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I \ndon't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \nBut I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies \nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \nwhen you tell people they can't do certain things in this country \nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\n\t     \n\t     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been \nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \nof their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \non this issue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \nof emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \nand in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to \nsee it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my \ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \nand that's what I'll continue to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \nBosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on \nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \nyour decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on \nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \ndecision?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There \nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \nrequired to embark on any new policy.\n\t     \n\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \nwar.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\n\t     \n\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't \ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \nwe couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \nthese wars?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument \nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  \nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \nof ethnic tensions exist.\n\n\t     Q\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \nYeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the \nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \n\n\t     Q\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more \ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \nhandle that situation differently now?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that \nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come \nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to \nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \nhave asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \nSessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \nhis future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing \nbefore you do decide?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \nI'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \nto do with the direction of the FBI.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \ntake a partisan view in this war?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \nbe successful.\n\t     \n\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \nlooking at what else we can do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \nAren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \nGermany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've \ngot all of our options under review.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \nmilitary operation?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  \nThat's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \nde facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  \nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \npower.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're \ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \n\t     \n\t     I do believe that there's every reason to think that \nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of \nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\n\t     \n\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \nrefinance their debt.  \n\t     \n\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \ntough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  \nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the \ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \nof this country.  \n\t     \n\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \nmillions of Americans.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \nSo I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  \nI feel good about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that \none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \npractically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own \ncountry, how can we do it for them?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \nIt's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be \nfair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \nbe tied by many members of Congress.\n\n\t     Q\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \nThe Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and \nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \npursued.  \n\n\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \nwill do that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \n\n\t     Q\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \norder to then build support for Russian aid?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \ntoward reform.\n\t     \n\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \neconomy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And \nin a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all \nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \nbecause they haven't produced the results that the people so \nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \n\t     \n\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \nthat's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \nthink that we should support that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready \nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \nagreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental \nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \n\t     \n\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \nposition, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty \nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an \nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \nviolating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an \napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out \nthe details of that.\n\t     \n\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only \nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \nregion, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot \nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \nknow, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for \nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong \nabout the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not \nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \ndetails needed to be improved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\n\t     \n\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \nevaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \nthink that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \ninterchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know \nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't \nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I \nwas encouraged by the last trip.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \nus to confirm good faith?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases \nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \nthose cases.  And we're not there yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \nvery influenced by how the families feel.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \nDole?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \nPresident, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all \nstrung out and we're divided.\"  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \nhundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could \nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \nBut the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and redo --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \nwe need more police officers on the street.  \n\t     \n\t     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once \nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \nstreet who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's \nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \nright to know the names of the senior officers?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \nan Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I \nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \nmight be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think \nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I \nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \n\t     \n\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \ncon.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing \nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \nforces, sir?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \ninto a ground war there?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our \nevaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never \nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \nparticipating in some of the activities? \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't \nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \nbe done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of \nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \nAnd that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \nbe here, but for others as well.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.\n\n                                 END1:48 P.M.

The programme, which starred David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson during its 12-year run, was shown in 140 countries at its height. Model Anna Nicole Smith's reality show and The Dukes of Hazzard were runners-up in the Broadcast magazine survey. The Simpsons and Dallas and 24 were among the magazine's list of the best all-time imports from the US. Soap operas Knots Landing, Falcon Crest plus The Bold And The Beautiful all made the top 10 of Transatlantic TV howlers. The Jerry Springer Show, which came in at sixth on the list, did not fare well.  Broadcast magazine said: \"British TV never realised how low it could go before Jerry showed the way.\" Baywatch rose to the top of the list for having \"mind-numbingly predictable scripts: beachgoer is saved from drowning,\" according to the magazine. Just inside the all-time worst top 10 came Extreme Makeover, which sees members of the public given thousands of pounds worth of plastic surgery.

{"text":" This year's clutch of Oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures.  In the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years. While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. \"We don't have a Titanic or a Lord of the Rings out there. I think it's fair to say it does concern us a bit,\" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen this year's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. Last year's ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board.  And the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars.  The film had taken $500m (\u00a3264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (\u00a3952m). \"Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,\" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"People like to have a vested interest in what they're watching. \"When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest.\" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (\u00a348m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only \u00a37m so far.  Low-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (\u00a324m) each. The year's biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (\u00a3231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (\u00a3137m). Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (\u00a3196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters.  But many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. \"I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,\" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. \"That's the People's Choice Awards. This is not about the public. This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock has won the Writers Guild of America's award for documentary feature writing.  The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald's fast food for an entire month. Spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood on Tuesday. Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.  Producer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film's backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films. Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonald's for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald's announced it was to scrap its \"supersized\" meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film. Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonald's libel action. Helen Steel and David Morris, from north London, dubbed the \"McLibel Two\", were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out At the end of the case the High Court in London ruled McDonald's had been libelled and awarded the company \u00a360,000 in damages, later reduced to \u00a340,000 on appeal.

I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by\nI think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that\nBenjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings\non Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how\nmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and \nAristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus\nmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,\nthe id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus\nexplained it far better and gave reasons.\n\nThomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They\ncan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these\nmen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,\nhe thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.\n\nHere's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians\nthat \"that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is \nspiritually discerned.\"  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a\nclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's\nincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally\nbizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on\nmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,\nit is a truth, explainable or not.\n\nAre any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those\ndot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front\nof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If\nyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals\nembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand\nout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,\nyou will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot\ntest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.\n\nA normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a\ntotal anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.\nIt is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything\nthat to him is as plain as day.\n\nThat it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.\nThe believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns\nfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the\nother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks\nI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and\nsay, \"No, you are weird.  You do not see.\"   Then it is time for a sanity\ncheck.  I go to another Christian and say, \"Do you see this.\"  And\nthey go, \"Yes.  It is an \"X\"\".  And I say, \"Thank God, I see the \"X\"\ntoo.\"\n\nIt is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to\nthe phrase, \n\n         \"He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\"\n\n\nI am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.

Our computer environment is pretty split\nbetween Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But\nthere are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users\nhere.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter\nwhich AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there\nis no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been \ninconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity\nin a DOS program to selectively transport the files.\n\nThe question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into\nwindows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is \nin a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite\nclear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.\n\n\n-- T.J. Fiske\n\ntfiske@qualcomm.com\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

Can anybody deny these facts?\n\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \nrevisionists say!\n\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd\/Turk (different Turkic groups)\n[SY] Georgian (muslim\/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\n\nOK.\n\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\n[SY] to hate Turks\/Kurds? It seems so...\n\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\naway!\n\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed\/raped\/... Turks and other muslim people\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \n\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\n\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks\/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\n[SY] different ethnic\/cultural\/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\n\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918\/19 had little to\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> \nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \nMassachusetts. \n\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\n[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.\n\nMy grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \ntoday.\n\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why \n[SY] should they become enemies?\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

{"text":"From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House)\nSubject: CLINTON: Fact Sheet on Russian Statement 4.23.93\n\n\n\n\n                         The White House\n\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nFor Immediate Release                             April 23, 1993\n\n\n\n                     Background Information:\n\n                    Advancing U.S. Relations \n        with Russia and the other New Independent States \n\n                         April 23, 1993\n\n\nAt the Vancouver summit, President Clinton and President Yeltsin \nagreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an \neconomic and strategic partnership between the U.S. and Russia.  \nSince then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps \nbe taken to move this process forward.  The Administration is \nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \non its government's commitment to reform.\n\n\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\n\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\n\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\n\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\n\n\nReview of COCOM\n\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\n\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\n\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \nother states.\n\n\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\n\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \nthis process.\n\n\nMultilateral Test Ban\n\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \nand that the two governments would consult with each other \naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \nmonths.    \n\n\nDetargeting\n\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \n\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\n\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \nlate May.\n\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\n\n\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\n\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \nreform in Russia and the other states.\n\n                           *    *    *\n\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \nstates.\n\n                               -30-\n\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Joss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards. Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.      I'm not really comfortable with the word urban. It's a word that's been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music. The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong. How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing? It's so far removed that I don't expect them to get it bang on. The music industry isn't championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. People don't feel like that's anything to do with us. I don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. It's not really relevant. If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she's signed to, then so be it. It's got nothing to do with what's really going on.    Urban as a genre is very broad. If you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop, R&B, garage and into that obviously comes soul. Joss Stone is a soul artist. Her first album was called The Soul Sessions. So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres, and there are offshoots of all of those. Joss Stone has had amazing success [in the US] given that she's a UK artist. What has really captured everybody's imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tunes and she looks good - I think that's what's done it.  The award for best British urban act was voted for by viewers of MTV Base.    I don't think Joss was not a worthy winner. She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. The fact that she's from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she's literally rural. The great thing about urban music is that there's a big range. If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that's where you can call it urban - that's where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from. Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldn't argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. It has to come across as real. That's the only cut-off point we have here and that's the only way by which we judge people.    What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural Britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. Race doesn't make a difference if everyone is included. Out of all the awards dished out yesterday, I'm still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.    A type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.  She might not be urban, but when did R&B become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? R&B stands for Rhythm And Blues, remember!  That Joss Stone is rubbish is certain. If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim  She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year. This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren't nominated or didn't win. I cant see why people can't just congratulate her for the talent that she is.  She did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music. Its a stupid phrase, and particularly British. In the states they tend to use hip hop and R&B, if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what I'm talking about. Very strange.  What's in a name? A rose by any other name etc... If people want to call it urban, why not? If we really analysed it, the term 'dance music' is misleading because it doesn't describe everything you can dance to.  Whilst I agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won. 'Urban' to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities - I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties I've been to. Good luck to Joss Stone, let's celebrate her victory - let's also question why, with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast - we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.  So, what you're saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn't black. And, if it is, then they shouldn't be acknowledged for it even if they're pretty dam good at it? She's 17, has an amazing voice, and won. Good on her. Oh, but she's not \"black\" well, let's make her feel real bad about it then. How dare she! Though hang on, didn't the so-called 'public' vote on this one?  This idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what \"Jazz\" was. The media then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling \"Jazz\", much to the chagrin of the artists. It would mean that \"blues\" would be put in the same mould as \"bebop\", \"cool\" and \"ragtime\", all very different styles at that time. Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. And so what of \"Urban\" music? In truth it's a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand. Soul and garage are worlds apart musically (Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam?), but no doubt have their connections. If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.  I demand a prize for rural music! Sucks to the cities- it's way better out here. We have hay, for one thing.  Excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely? I dont understand the point that Ty is making. If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss' work won, he might have said nothing. (btw i'm black too)  How can she be \"urban\" if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside? Nonsense.  I love Joss to bits and don't care what her branding is - it's amazing music, full stop. Stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black \/ urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.  Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from. Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music. If that person was good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style?  The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards. The very term 'Music of Black Origin' has confused and offended many people. This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards. It appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. The term 'urban' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind. The result is now a redundant new debate as to what 'urban' also means. Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul\/RnB and Hip-Hop, one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with 'Crunk'.  Urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe \"black\" music that's become popular now. The word wasn't even in use, or common use five of six years ago. It's just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.  I'm in a band that has been called \"urban\", and I despise the label. I'd hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche, because that's all it is. Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.  As a black man, I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. Black people should lead the music they invented . We should stop calling a genre meaningless, northing is meaningless. The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? Same thing, with Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Who's ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson.. They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????  So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards. Her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'Urban' banner? What if The Streets had won? Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white... It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else.  Urban is PC version for saying black music. I'm not doubting Ms Stone's talent, but why didn't Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit? This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past, getting nominations are easy to get, but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing.  Refreshing to see people making reasonable, intelligent comments on any topic these days. More power to you, people! You have said it: there is music you like and music you don't like - who cares what label you put on it?  That entire category was a mess. How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone? Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof. She should have been nominated for Best British R & B act. Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.  Urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin? Well doesn't that include rock? Music made in the inner cities? Well almost all bands end up making music in London\/Manchester etc. And doesn't that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? It doesn't make any sense.  Why does music have to be put into a genre? It's music, you like it or you don't. Simple as that.  I play in a heavy metal band. We are urban music as far as I'm concerned. We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; It therefore directly shapes what we write musically.  \"Urban\" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. Why it needed a rebrand I don't know as the name is misleading. Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term \"urban\" yet as they're a white rock band they won't be described as such.  Joss Stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the Brit? All this \"urban\" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.  Yeah, she deserved it. She is talented. Urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. There's only two kinds of music: good and bad. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The late John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show is to be succeeded in February by three shows hosted by three DJs focusing on diverse, non-commercial music.  Huw Stephens, Ras Kwame and Rob Da Bank will each host the mid-week, late-night timeslot, showcasing UK talent. Radio 1 said the show would not try to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. Peel died after suffering a heart attack in Peru in October. Radio 1 said the three DJs had been chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\". Rob Da Bank has been hosting The John Peel Show since the DJ's death. He is also one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens is currently one half of the Radio 1 Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in Wales. And Ras Kwame is the host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1's digital station 1Xtra. His show is dedicated to showcasing the best of UK black music and broadcasts live sessions, often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.  All of the three DJs will continue to host their current shows on Radio 1. \"It is widely accepted that John Peel can never be replaced,\" said the radio station. It added that One Music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said: \"It will seek out those making music for music's sake rather than for commercial success. \"Above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.\"  One Music is not new to Radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. Radio 1's controller, Andy Parfitt, said: \"We believe that by having a series of DJs hosting a selection of shows under the One Music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on.\" Stephens said he grew up \"listening to John\" and that it was a \"massive honour\" to continue Peel's work championing new music. The show will be broadcast from 1 February on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2300 GMT - 0100 GMT. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time \nto do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often\nfalls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  \n\nStrawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like\ndemands.  I suspect that a comment like \"I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm\nused to it\" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if\nit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,\n\"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best\nin that role.\"  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like\na fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question \nlike, \"How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?\"\nA more media-sensitive player might answer \"The manager knows what he is\ndoing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I\nam all for it.\"  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a\nlittle bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.\n\nPersonally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't\nmatter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,\nexcept for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that\nquestion, \"The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\npaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing\nto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.\"  or something like\nthat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\nhitting third--and make him sound like a \"team\" player.  Since Strawberry\nwill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for\nhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   \nhis image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.\n\nRemember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hit\nfourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is\ntrue.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Jeff\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":"From: techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon)\nSubject: The earth also pollutes......\n\nFURY OF MOTHER NATURE\n\nMan's contribution to environmental \"pollution\" are paltry compared to those \nof nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy \nCommision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, \"all \nof the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the \nindustrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic \nmaterials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three \nvolcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and \nHekla in Iceland in 1947.\" To which could be added Mount St. Helens in \nWashington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon \ndioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million \ntons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the \nPhilippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into \nthe stratosphere).\nLOS NINOS\nMany environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global \nwarming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in \nBoulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a \nnatural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive \ncurrents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that \nperiodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's \nweather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold \nwater that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for \nthousands of miles.\nCHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: \"Cold water along \nthe equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The \nresult was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped \nBangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and \ndistorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet \nStream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the \nU.S. resulting in drought.\"\nTERMITE TERROR\n\nSundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental \n\"degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in \"the Netherlands... manure \nfrom pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with \nexcessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred \nthe landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are \nravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage \nstanding forrests.\"\nThe February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that \"an international \nteam of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the \nCarbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does.\" According to a study reported in \nSCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the \"estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide \nproduced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil \nfuel combustion.\" In addition, \"Termites are a potentially important source \nof atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global \nemmisions.\" The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too \ndigest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, \nmethane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.\nAnts are another natural source of \"pollution.\" In 1987, an atmospheric \nchemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, \nreported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities \nof the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in \nremote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the \nglobe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the \nrain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT \nmagazine, the \"ants release the acid when defending themselves and \ncommunicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world \nant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about  \nthe acid the ants release,\" an amount estimated at \"600,000 metric tons \nannually.\" which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of \nautomobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation.\"\nClearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a \"despoiler\" of the \nenvironment.\nBy Robert W.

The stats show he\nis a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened\nto win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good\ngames. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was \nconstantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)\nand the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in\nhis 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would\nleave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win\ngames (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).\n\n\nBarry Walker\nBNR \nOttawa\nCanada\n\nMy opinions\n\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

I've seen Gravis\njoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my\nhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.

{"text":" Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes.  Lee Miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick. McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum. Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.  Then McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrum's far post. The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, Burton O'Brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by Neil MacFarlane, but Dair sent his shot just inches wide.

{"text":" Actor Bruce Willis is suing Revolution Studios over an injury he said he suffered while making Tears of the Sun.  Willis is seeking medical expenses after he said he was hit in the head by a firework during the filming of the 2002 movie, produced by the firm. The lawsuit said the star has endured mental and physical injuries as a result of the alleged incident. \"We are not able to comment on pending litigation,\" Revolution Studios spokesman Sean Dudas said.  In Tears of the Sun Willis plays a US military commander who disobeys orders to try and help save a doctor and patients trapped in the Nigerian jungle. Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film was poorly received by critics and did not perform strongly at the box office. According to the lawsuit, the injury was suffered during the firing of explosions as part of a special effect. The explosions, known as squibs, were intended to \"simulate the appearance of bullets striking the ground\". The lawsuit said Willis has endured \"extreme mental, physical and emotional pain and suffering.\" There were no specific details on the injuries. While Willis does not seek specific monetary damages, the lawsuit noted that the star \"was required to and did employ physicians and other medical personnel\". It stated he will incur additional future medical expenses. The lawsuit said Revolution Studios and special effects foreman Joe Pancake \"had a duty to Willis to ensure that the squibs were inspected, set up, placed and detonated in a safe manner, and to employ technicians who were trained and competent in their use\".

O'Driscoll heads a star-studded cast for the contest to raise funds for the tsunami appeal. The South will be led by George Gregan, one of four Wallabies, alongside five Springboks and four All Blacks including captain Tana Umaga. South African flanker Schalk Burger has shaken off a leg injury to take his place in the starting line-up. He will join fellow Springboks John Smit, Cobus Visagie and Victor Matfield in the South pack, with Jacque Fourie among the centres. The North side have been hit by the withdrawals of Scotland duo Gordon Bulloch and Chris Cusiter, plus France captain Fabien Pelous.  But Leicester's England centre Ollie Smith has been added to the squad, giving him an opportunity to impress Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward, who takes charge of the North side. \"I think it's fantastic for Ollie,\" Tigers coach John Wells told BBC Radio Leicester. \"He was probably going to have the weekend off this week and I hope Clive gets the chance to see the qualities that Leicester and England have been seeing all year.\" Woodward will also assess other potential Lions candidates such as Scotland pair Simon Taylor and Chris Paterson, Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel and Ireland lock Paul O'Connell. \"I'm looking forward to working with such outstanding players,\" Woodward said. \"Both teams are fielding top-quality sides and I really hope that the rugby public and community get behind this game to raise as much money as possible for such a deserving cause.\" Despite the withdrawal of Wales wing Rhys Williams, who is required for the Blues' Celtic League match with Munster, three other members of their Six Nations squad - Ceri Sweeney, John Yapp and Jonathan Thomas - will also play. \"Not only it is for a good cause but it gives these players the opportunity to play with and against some of the best players in the world,\" said WRU general manager Steve Lewis. Supporters can watch the teams train for free at Twickenham on Friday, 4 March.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable\nwith the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can\nbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is\neliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious \nconsideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  \n\nFor example, does \"non-initiated force\" (coercion) include tax collection?\nDoes it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned\nby Adam Smith?

I'd venture to point out, \nhowever, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group \nof \"seminar participants\" to \"embrace\" their philosophy, their \npropaganda skills need to be honed.  \n\nFrankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a \nsociety in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper\ngovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities\ncan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,\nthe state will just wither away.  \n\nOn the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating \nvirtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the \ncurrent society will help us to live happier lives?

{"text":" Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.  The Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week. Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.  According to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman's publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she's willing to put up with some of it, but it's gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Playing colours:  All black  The Haka and more!  The All Blacks  Charles John Munro discovered rugby at London's Christ College, and on his return to Nelson he staged New Zealand's first game. Nelson Town met Nelson College on 14 May, 1870, the Town triumphing by two goals to nil, instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country's sporting passions. The game appealed to the Kiwi psyche and quickly spread, the native Maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport's warrior ethos. In 1888 a British team led by AE Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia, and soon after a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an English ex-pat called Thomas Eyton decided to gather a combined New Zealand team.  Twenty-two Maori and four 'pakiha' formed the 'New Zealand Native Team,' who played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The integration of white and Maori was a reflecion of enlightened New Zealand rugby and society, even if the British press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the Maori war dance, the Haka! The other great symbol of New Zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by Tom Ellison at the first annual meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1893. New Zealand played their first international against Australia in 1903, the Kiwis triumphing 22-3 in Sydney, and the following year an official British touring team came to New Zealand for the first time. The tourists had gone through Australia undefeated but their captain, David Revell Bedell-Sivright, created animosity in New Zealand with his patronising attitude. The Kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in Wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but Bedell-Sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the UK.  Their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official New Zealand tour to Europe. The tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a 'roving' forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. The tactic was effective, two late tries seeing the Kiwis to a 12-7 win over Scotland, before Ireland were despatched 15-0 in Dublin. A huge crowd at Crystal Palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the Haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of England. New Zealand headed to Wales to meet a country in the midst of its first 'Golden Age,' and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. An excellent try on the left wing by Teddy Morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at Cardiff Arms Park, but post-match talk was dominated by a Bob Deans try that was ruled out by Scottish referee John Dallas. Dallas said that Deans was tackled short, but the Kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: \"I did score that try in Cardiff.\"  Four of the 1905 All Blacks went over to the newly formed 'All Golds' rugby league side soon after the tour, but New Zealand were strong enough to crush an Anglo-Welsh touring team in 1908. The first South Africa tour of New Zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-Test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the All Blacks' inclusion of Maori players. The awesome 1924-5 All Black tourists became known as 'The Invincibles' after winning all 30 of their games in France, Britain and Ireland, including a crushing 19-0 victory over Wales at St Helen's. Despite their success, the All Blacks' 2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times, and the flaws were exploited by the Springboks in South Africa in 1928. Employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the New Zealand 'rover' system for the first time, South African teams defeated the All Blacks in five games and the Test series was drawn two-all. The controversial New Zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 Lions tour (a series won 3-1 by New Zealand), the Lions manager describing the tactic as 'cheating,' prompting the International Rugby Board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  The All Blacks' 1935 European tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a Swansea side inspired by teenage, schoolboy half-backs Hayden Tanner and Willie Davies. A thrilling Test at Cardiff Arms Park went to Wales 13-12, although the winning try from Geoffrey Rees-Jones was controversial following an illegal Claude Davey tackle in the build-up. New Zealand's next visit to Wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to Cardiff and drew 6-6 at Swansea. The All Blacks were on top in the Test with Wales at the Arms Park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a Clem Thomas cross kick was gathered by Ken Jones for a famous, match-winning try. The tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations, before a 19-5 success over the Barbarians in an Arms Park thriller. New Zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  That made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student John Uzzell gave Newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at Rodney Parade. Wilson Whinneray's side rallied to beat Wales 6-0, their first win at the Arms Park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was: \"What happened in Newport?\" The only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with East Wales, as they beat the full Wales team 13-6 in Cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. That lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in New Zealand in 1969, the first time Wales had toured the country as an independent team.  A ferocious game at the Arms Park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the All Blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on New Zealand by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971.  James guided Llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at Stradey Park, though, and in the final game of the tour the Barbarians defeated the All Blacks 23-11 in Cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. New Zealand defeated a Wales XV 12-3 at the Arms Park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in Cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  Wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when Andy Haden flew to the floor from a line-out. Television pictures clearly showed that he dived, but English referee Roger Quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty, duly converted by Brian McKechnie for a 13-12 win. Since that infamous game, the competition has largely left Wales v New Zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. A crushing 23-3 win for New Zealand in Cardiff in the Welsh Rugby Union's 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. The new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left Europe behind was shown as the All Blacks swatted Wales aside 49-6 in Brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural World Cup. The Kiwis went on to claim the Cup, and would inflict further misery on Wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of New Zealand.  A young, talented Wales side left Britain full of confidence as Triple Crown winners, but one of the greatest ever New Zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. After also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, Wales captain Jonathan Davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of Wales' best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  A 34-9 win in Cardiff followed for New Zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 World Cup Wales' big talk was made to look embarrassing as the All Blacks eased to victory in Johannesburg. A crushing 42-7 Kiwi triumph in Wembley followed in 1997, and as Wales' misery increased they turned to New Zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches Graham Henry and Steve Hansen. There was a temporary resurgence in the Welsh game, but when an experimental New Zealand side came to Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  A bruising 55-3 defeat followed for Wales in Hamilton in 2003 as Hansen built towards the World Cup, but in Australia it was a remarkable performance against the All Blacks that gave his side renewed hope. Wales were given no chance going into the game, but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. New Zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by Wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. They now face an All Blacks team led by Henry and Hansen, coming to Europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. An encouraging display against South Africa has inspired a confident Wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. They have a chance, but clearly history is not on their side. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\n\n| Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\n| keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\n| pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\n| just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of\n| getting boned in the process.\n\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\nbut that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you\nare referring to).\n\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\nsystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\n\n| Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\n| aren't entitled to a \"peek under the covers\" as the Big Kids (NASA,\n| for instance) are.

He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week\nwhen he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video\nuntil he dropped the gloves...\n\n>On the subject of realignment, Don said that he liked the\n>new division names.\n\nWell, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite\nsome time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division\nnames.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades\nor so....he also invited the audience to \"Name the teams in the Wales...quick,\nquick!\" Followed by \"Ah, you don't know, I don't know....\"  \n\nSorry Don.  Wrong on this one.\n\n>Ron (to Don): \"I don't know wy I like you on your show\n>for 30 minutes...

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n\n\nmathew\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

(Lawful vs. unlawful use of guns)\nFrom: kim39@scws8.harvard.edu (John Kim)\n\nI have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective \nself-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the\npro-RKBA arguments presented here.\n\nThe numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a\nmillion) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring\ncriminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number\nof gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000\/year?).  However,\nit is surprising that the \"Evil AntiGun Empire \" (Darth Vader\nbreathing sound effect here) never tries to compare\n\"All legitimate gun defenses\" vs. \"All gun crimes.\"  Instead, \nit's always \"All legitimate gun defenses,\"  which includes\ncases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and\ncases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just \ncriminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which\nthe victim died.\n\nWhy is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say\nthat in each crime already measured (involving guns), the\nconsequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that\na gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn\ninto a gun-basd robbery+homicide.

Perhaps because the Gazans aren't\n  starving?\n\n# The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\n# density in the world,\n\n  Oh, oh.  I hadn't realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong\n  Kong, or that Singapore had sunk into the sea, or that several\n  other cities had vanished.  Either that, or this is a taste of\n  the quality of 'Research' we're about to see.\n\n#                       has been cut off from the world for weeks.\n\n  So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival,\n  and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style?  Or is this\n  another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth?\n\n# The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\n# Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\n# strip and seek work in Israel.\n\n  Hey!  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same\n  'right'.  Come to think of it, Mexico is denying me that 'right'\n  evan as I write this!  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that\n  Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, shouldn't be allowed\n  to control traffic across its borders?\n\n# While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n# Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n# the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\n# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\n\n  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn't.  Tell us how many Poles\n  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment\n  there I forgot that in Poland, 'humanitarian assistance\" could\n  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to\n  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,\n  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.\n\n  So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the\n  same, we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:\n    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?\n    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?\n    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?\n    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?\n    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?\n  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter\n  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?\n\n------------\n\nContrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill\noff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.\n(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)\nNote that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\nexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.\n\nSo if a \"Final Solution\" for Gaza would be so much better from\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?  A\ndifficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything\ngood about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit\nthe facts into the theory.\n\n\n--- D. C.

{"text":" Making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told.  Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual E3 games Expo in Los Angeles in May. These so-called \"next generation\" machines will be faster than current consoles, and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. For gamers, this should make for better, more immersive games. In a pre-recorded video slot during Microsoft's keynote address at the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco, famed director James Cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be Battle Angel Alita. The game's visual quality would be \"like a lucid dream,\" said Mr Cameron. But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. The first new console, Microsoft's Xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. Games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today.  According to Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. Such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said Mr Walsh. \"If you're a start-up, I doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are,\" he said. Mr Walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS, since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.  One developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. The founder of California's Maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game, Spore. Spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. Starting with an amoeba-sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve.  Eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities, trading and fighting, and even building space ships. Advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other Spore players. These worlds will be automatically swapped across the Internet. Mr Wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game. \"I don't want to put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins - I want them to be George Lucas or Dr Seuss,\" explained Mr Wright. Few games have hinted at the scope of Spore, but Mr Wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. Instead of employing lots of artists to create 3D models of the digital creatures, Spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. \"The thing I am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market,\" said Mr Wright. \"I'd like to offer an alternative to that.\"  New development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.  Oxford-based Natural Motion launched Endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3D 'virtual actor'. The actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. Endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs, for instance, or crumples up after a gunshot. Artists can blend together these visual sequences, and include the results in their games. The process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand, and so lessens the need for larger art teams. Another British company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is Manchester start-up Genemation. Its latest tool, GenCrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. GenCrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. The software can create up to 2,000 new heads an hour.  One area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. Even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.  The Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. A niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago, GDC's Mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. Mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games. Furthermore, the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. It's predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. The growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile. EA Mobile is a division of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher. Until recently Electronic Arts had been dismissive of games for phones. \"The last time you checked, EA wasn't in this business,\" Mr Batter admitted. But he said EA now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. EA plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. The first will be a version of its Need for Speed racing game, created by EA Mobile's 30-person development team. Mr Batter predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on Sony's upcoming PSP handheld console.

{"text":" Stars of the Eurovision Song Contest from the show's 50-year history are to compete against each other to celebrate the contest's anniversary.  Viewers will choose 14 past songs to be performed by the original artists or others in the spirit of the originals. Past Eurovision performers include Abba, Celine Dion, Bucks Fizz, Nana Mouskouri, Lulu and Julio Iglesias. Fans will then vote as usual to pick the all-time best Eurovision song during the show in Denmark in October. The first contest was organised by the European Broadcasting Union, or EBU, in 1956, and has become an annual event pitting pop giants against musical minnows - with often surprising results.  While some regard it as an essential celebration of continental talent, others see it as an equally unmissable parade of the reasons some countries do not normally produce international stars. The 50th annual contest will be held in Kiev, Ukraine, in May, after Ukrainian singer Ruslana won last year. The 50th anniversary special will be held in Denmark later this year because the Danish Broadcasting Corporation came up with the idea for the all-time contest. A plan to hold it in London was scrapped because of problems finding a suitable venue. Ireland has been the most successful country in the show's history with seven victories, followed by the UK, France and Luxembourg with five each. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time\/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits\/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits\/pixel, not 24.

Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"\/\"medium\"\/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet\/news.answers\/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet\/news.answers\/ftp-list\/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib\/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib\/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS\/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub\/jpeg\/viewers\/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386\/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG\/GIF\/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos\/graphics\/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS\/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning\/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/gif\/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos\/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"\/pub\/msdos\/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file \/pub\/bryanw\/pc\/jpeg\/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos\/windows3\/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS\/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check \/pub\/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n\/pub\/os2\/all\/graphics\/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS\/2 1.x.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion\/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS\/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG\/GIF\/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11\/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT\/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT\/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer\/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT\/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/art\/gif\/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG\/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/qt.1.0.stuff\/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer\/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/app\/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under \/mirrors\/amiga.physik.unizh.ch\/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer\/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/edit\/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga\/os30\/gfx\/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG\/ILBM\/GIF\/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/show\/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga\/gfx\/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file \/atari\/Graphics\/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file \/atari\/Graphics\/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read\/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory \/graphics\/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos\/graphics\/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM\/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n\/pub\/usenet\/news.answers\/compression-faq\/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF\/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF\/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF\/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression\/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression\/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1\/2 or 1\/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1\/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!).

{"text":" The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.  New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (\u00a3130,000) fine.  In a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Paul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.  Sculthorpe was vice-captain in the Tri-Nations, and took the St Helens captaincy from Chris Joynt last year. \"I would definitely want the job - I make no bones about it,\" Sculthorpe told BBC Sport. \"It's something I've always wanted to do. I'd gladly take it if it was offered to me.\"  The 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge. \"Andy would be a hard act to follow but it's something I'm confident of being up to,\" he said. \"The GB team isn't a one-man team. There are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway.\"  Sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if Farrell did decide to move to rugby union. \"It's a short career and you have to make of it what you can,\" said Sculthorpe. \"Nobody can blame him if he does go - he's done everything in the game of rugby league.  \"Financially it could set him up for life. If he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him?\" Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play. Sean Long, Sculthorpe's Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future \"I think Sean's situation is to do with the sheer number of games we're playing,\" he said.  \"The way he's looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he's willing to do that. \"The RFL has got to do something about the fixtures. We're playing 42 weeks of the year and it's too much. \"A lot of the niggly injuries that I've suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time.\" St Helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward Sonny Bill Williams, and Sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to Knowsley Road. \"He's a great player - a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful,\" he said. \"I'd love him to come to St Helens. Who knows what might happen? But you want the best players in your team, and he's certainly one of the best players in the world.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.

In the \nsecond half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.\nThese battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were\nattached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were\nthe field battalions II\/9, I\/125 and I\/198 which were formed between\nMay 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the\nNazi army, if battalion II\/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be\nincluded.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.\nArmenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours \nred-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'\n\n[1] Joachim Hoffmann, 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943, Turkotataren, \n    Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer,' (Verlag Rombach\n    Freiburg 1976), p. 172.\n\nWhile having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the\nSecond World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's\ndefeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,\nhoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim \npopulation would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national\nsentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America\nfor his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish\ngovernment led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.\n\n[1] Walter Kolarz, 'Religion in the Soviet Union,' (London, Macmillan &\n    Co Ltd; New York, St Martin's Press 1961), pp. 160-164.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

{"text":" Music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business.  The cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.  \"Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,\" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative.  Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.  This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers \"greater value\" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. \"We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,\" he said. \"Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?\" Wippit offers a download subscription service for \u00a34.99 per month or \u00a350 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" World number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.  Top seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week's final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him all the way. \"I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,\" Federer said.  \"That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side.\" Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. \"I didn't start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,\" he said. \"After those first three games it was no match at all. I don't know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.\" But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. \"I had a chance in the third, and for me it's really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. \"It's an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I'm up there and belong with top-class players.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

The deadliest of terrorist assassins,\nCarlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had\nentered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they\nare using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter\ninnocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role \nin this scheme?\n\nRecent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration, \nindicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with \nthose who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine \nbarracks in Beirut.

Last year Bafana Bafana were humbled in the first by minnows Mauritius who beat them 2-0 in Curepipe. Coach Stuart Baxter and his squad will return to Curepipe face the Seychelles in their first game of the new-look regional competition. The format of the event has been changed this year after the entry of the Seychelles, who have taken the number of participants to 13. The teams are now divided into three group of four and play knock-out matches on successive days to determine the group champions. Mauritius host the first group, and their opponents are Madagascar, the Seychelles and South Africa. Bafana Bafana play the Seychelles before Mauritius take on Madagascar in a double-header on 26 February. The two winners return to the New George V stadium the next day and the victor of the group decider advances to August's final mini-tournament. The second group will be hosted in Namibia in April. It comprises Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and the hosts. In June, former champions Zambia will host Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland in the third group in Lusaka. The three group winners will then join title holders Angola for the last of the mini-tournaments in August, where the winners will be crowned.

{"text":" Nintendo's DS handheld game console has officially gone on sale in Europe.  Many stores around the UK opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. The two-screen clamshell gadget costs \u00a399 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch, some featuring well-known characters such as Super Mario and Rayman. The DS spearheads Nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.  Since going on sale in Japan and the US at the end of 2004, Nintendo has sold almost 4m DS consoles.  Part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld. Games for the DS are expected to cost between \u00a319 and \u00a329. About 130 games for the DS are in development.  As well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the DS also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. A \"download play\" option means DS owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. Other DS owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. Nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. Five Virgin megastores and 150 Game shops were expected to open early on Friday morning to let people buy a DS. \"We know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day,\" said Robert Quinn, Game's UK sales director.  But Nintendo will only have sole control of Europe's handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon Sony is expected to release its PSP console. Although Nintendo is aiming for younger players and the PSP is more for older gamers, it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. Sony's PSP represents a real threat to Nintendo because of the huge number of PlayStation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. The PSP uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. When it goes on sale the PSP is likely to cost between \u00a3130 and \u00a3200. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

My opinion is that the agent\nin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,\nmurder, civil rights violations, and breaking his\/her oath to uphold and defend\nthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the \npublic what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault\non American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,\nthe Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for\nBATF wrongdoing.\n\nJames\n\nbtw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.\n\n\n\n-- \n********************************************************************************\nJames S.

{"text":"From: lvc@cbnews.cb.att.com (Larry Cipriani)\nSubject: DeConcini -- ten years ago and today\n\n Dennis Deconcini, 1982\n \n...In these and similar areas, the\nBureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5\nU.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent \"secret lawmaking\" by\nadministrative bodies.\n   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-\ncommittee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded\nrights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United\nStates.\n   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise\nof the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.\n   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-\ning and seizing private property.\n   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property\nwithout just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-\nout regard for their right to due process of law.\n   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was\nutterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\nBATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\nunknowning technical violations.\n \n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\n                                REPORT\n                                of the\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\n                                of the\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\n                            SECOND SESSION\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\n88-618 O\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\n \n \nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\n \n \nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\n \nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\ngangs from access to weapons.\n \nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\ntrace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\nis the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\n \nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\nprepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\n \nBased on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\nand peaceful conclusion.\n \nSincerely,\n \nDennis DeConcini\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\nPostal Service and\nGeneral Government\n \nApril 7, 1993\n \n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" The Aviator has been named best film at the Golden Globe Awards, with its star Leonardo DiCaprio named best actor.  Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood took the best director prize for Million Dollar Baby while its star Hilary Swank was best actress. Quirky comedy Sideways was named best screenplay and best comedy. Ray star Jamie Foxx was best actor in a musical\/comedy while Briton Clive Owen and Natalie Portman won prizes for best supporting roles in Closer.  The Aviator, in which DiCaprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes, edged ahead of its rivals at the Beverly Hills ceremony by winning the best original score prize. This give it a total of three awards while Million Dollar Baby, Sideways and Closer took two Golden Globes each. Accepting his best dramatic actor prize, DiCaprio described director Martin Scorsese as \"one of the greatest contributors to the world of cinema of all time\".  Annette Bening won best actress in a musical\/comedy for Being Julia while Spanish movie The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film. Swank, who previously won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, paid tribute to Million Dollar Baby director and co-star Clint Eastwood. \"You guided us so brilliantly, while you also, in my humble opinion, gave the performance of your career,\" she said. Foxx was nominated for three awards but was beaten to the best supporting actor title by Owen and the best actor in a TV movie prize by Geoffrey Rush in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.  A BBC co-production, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers was also named best TV movie. Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart won the best original song award for Old Habits Die Hard from movie re-make Alfie, while Ian McShane was named best actor in a TV drama for his lead role in Deadwood.  Other UK hopes Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton went home empty-handed despite lead actress nominations for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Vera Drake respectively. Winning a Golden Globe is said to improve a film or performer's chance of subsequently winning an Academy Award. Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes split awards by genre - one prize for dramas and the other for musicals and comedies. The Globes also honour the best in television, with suburban series Desperate Housewives named best TV comedy show. Actress Teri Hatcher beat fellow Desperate Housewives stars Marcia Cross and Felicity Huffman to the best comedy actress prize.  Hatcher thanked the show's cast, crew and \"a network who gave me a second chance at a career when I couldn't have been a bigger 'has been'\". Cosmetic surgery series Nip\/Tuck beat The Sopranos and Deadwood to the best television drama title. Arrested Development star Jason Bateman was named best TV actor in a musical or comedy series. The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, comprising film reporters based in Los Angeles and working for overseas outlets. Robin Williams, a five-time Globe winner for such films as The Fisher King and Good Morning, Vietnam, received the Cecil B DeMille award for career achievement. He dedicated his prize to Superman actor Christopher Reeve, who died last year. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" A total of 267 films are eligible for the best film Oscar but only five will be chosen to go forward as nominees.  The Academy of Motion Picture, Arts and Sciences has sent out the first ballot papers with the full list of films vying for recognition. Among those expected to receive nominations are The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Sideways. Academy members will now vote for their favourites before the final nominees are announced on 25 January.  To be eligible for nomination a film must have been shown in a commercial theatre for seven consecutive days before the deadline of 31 December. Director Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio went on general release on Christmas Day in the US, ensuring it just made the deadline. Studios have already begun lobbying voters, taking out full page adverts in trade publications such as Variety urging them to remember particular films when it comes to choosing what to back. Other movies tipped for possible success include Closer, starring Jude Law and Julia Roberts, Finding Neverland, with Johnny Depp as author JM Barry and Kinsey starring Liam Neeson as the famed sex scientist Alfred Kinsey. Meanwhile, design engineer Takuo Miyagishima will be awarded an Oscar at the Scientific and Technical Awards Dinner on 12 February 2005. Miyagishima is the 18th recipient of the Sawyer Award, which is \"presented to an individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry.\" The main Oscar ceremony will be held in Los Angeles on 27 February.

{"text":" World number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.  Top seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week's final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. \"I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,\" Federer said.  \"That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side.\" Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. \"I didn't start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,\" he said. \"After those first three games it was no match at all. I don't know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.\" But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. \"I had a chance in the third, and for me it's really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. \"It's an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I'm up there and belong with top-class players.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\n\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\n\nShaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.\nI've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\n\n- How exactly did they do this?\n\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\nNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\nto be a Turkish Jew.\n\n- How so?\n\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\nYou  can't do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\n\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\nParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\nconsuls took place.\n\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\nconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\n\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\n\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\n\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\ngovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of\nthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\n\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\nfrom Nazi persecution.\n\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\ncouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\nthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\n\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\nsend money and food out of the country.\n\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\nliving in Israel.\n\nYes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\n\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\n\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\n\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\n\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\ncould see the documents.\n\n- What languages are used in the documents?\n\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\n\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\nsomeday will make the effort.\n\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?\n\nRight. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\n\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\n\nI'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\nall sorts of political movements.\n\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\nHolocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

Dido, Robbie Williams and Chris Martin are among those featured on the new version of Do They Know It's Christmas?, which is raising money to fight hunger in Africa. If the track sold 500,000 copies, more than \u00a31m would be raised for charity. The CD is being sold for \u00a33.99, with HMV, Virgin and Woolworths all donating their profits.

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.  Kevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. In the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the Wales back row in place of Jonathan Thomas. Wales coach Mike Ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship. \"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right,\" said Ruddock. \"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week.\"  Despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions France are also unbeaten. Under-pressure coach Bernard Laporte has made four changes, with Yannick Nyanga, the debutant Julien Laharrague, Aurelien Rougerie and Yannick Jauzion coming into the side. France have been criticised for the absence of traditional \"French flair\" as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain Fabien Pelous sees hope on the horizon. \"I get the impression we are getting better,\" he said. \"Against Wales, which is different from the teams we have beaten, I hope we can show our proper game.\"  J Laharrague; A Rougerie, Y Jauzion, D Traille, C Dominici; Y Delaigue, D Yachvili; S Marconnet, S Bruno, N Mas; F Pelous (capt), J Thion; S Betsen, Y Nyanga, J Bonnaire (Bourgoin).

First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of\nweapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to \"weapon.\"\nThe second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w\/gun\ndefenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for\nthis, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going \nahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.\n\n      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and\nnot just a reporting difference?

{"text":" The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.  The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements. For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun. Call of Duty: Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa. It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. On a near-identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. Its arenas are the war's Pacific battles, including Guadalcanal and Pearl Harbour. You play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative US soldier.  Both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. When this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. When it does not, it is tedious.  A winning moment is an early scene in Pacific Assault, where you come under attack at the famous US base in Hawaii. You are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of Japanese planes, then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman, before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. It is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. The genius of something like Half Life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. This pair of games do not really accomplish that, being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience.  Call of Duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. Finest Hour has a similar determination, framing everything in moody wartime music, archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs.  Letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the Call of Duty endeavour, even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. The game's drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on PC. The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. Call of Duty on PC was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. Targeting with the PS2 controller proved tricky, not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. You can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim, yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. Checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot, which happens regularly, you are set harshly far back, and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that. It is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its PC parent, the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive.  Both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. And in Pacific Assault in particular, their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless.  But the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. It engages you very well and also looks wonderful, making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious Far Cry, although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. Finest Hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the PC original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. But they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst Bill Thompson. It is what happens when it arrives at the other end.  The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data. The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities. Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name. And it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.  But, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. It is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. In fact, I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. Has anyone checked Bob Cratchit's family links to the criminal underworld, I wonder? And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. Health authorities, government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like Amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. The good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files.  Companies like SecureWave, for example, can restrict the use of USB ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual's personal memory card. These solutions are not perfect, but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. However the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the 'back office'. It has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked.  In fact I do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.  There are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. CD Universe, Powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused? Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it. Unauthorised disclosure is not allowed, but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. This is not something we can just leave it to the market. The consequences of having one's identity stolen are too serious, and markets respond too slowly. After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems. I doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves, partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients, so I know which I'd prefer.

Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \nand remains without a job. \n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\n\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\n\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\n\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\n\n  pages 82-83:\n\n<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\n\n   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from\n   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript\n   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.\n\n   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the\n   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\n   end of a gun.\n\n   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\n\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\n   no more heard of.\n\n   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\n\n   The Greeks killed also many Jews.

{"text":" Uefa says it will allow European matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season.  European football's governing body made the decision at a meeting of its Executive Committee on Wednesday. Uefa explained that the move \"follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces.\" They can be used subject to complying with Uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory. Luton, Preston, Queens Park Rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but, after a two-year study, Uefa insists the surfaces have moved on. International matches can also be played on such pitches, although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass. Uefa spokesman Rob Faulkner said: \"People in England have bad memories of the artificial pitches of Luton and QPR in the 1980s, but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass. \"We have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards.\" Several leading clubs from Scandinavia, Russia and eastern Europe - especially those who only play Champions League or Uefa Cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches.

Jagr,\nMacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one\nelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.\n\nDespite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing\nadantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and\nkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens\nbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to\nconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new\nlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.\n\nBowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an\nindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed\nof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As\na result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played\nalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern\nscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.\nHis ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is\ncommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might\nsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about\nsuccess.\n\nWhile no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,\nBowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly\nseen, mark in  Pittsburgh. \n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" New Zealand proved too strong for an Australian-dominated Barbarians to round off their unbeaten northern hemisphere tour with an easy win.  Rico Gear ran in two of the All Blacks' seven tries in what was a predominantly second-string line-up. The Baa-Baas did threaten, scoring tries through Albert van den Bergh, Xavier Rush and Andrea Lo Cicero, but never looked like winning. All Black Aaron Mauger was in good form with the boot, adding 10 points. The All Blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend's emphatic Test victory over France in Paris, while the Baa-Baas had nine Wallabies in their starting line-up. And New Zealand coach Graham Henry said: \"It was a quality performance against a very experienced side and a number of young guys came through very well. \"They learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour.\" But the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised. Marty Holah got the All Blacks onslaught under way with his fifth-minute try before Rush hit back moments later. But New Zealand went ahead once more as Gear made use of the space vacated by a temporarily injured Chris Latham to slide in. Ma'a Nonu then found his way through the Barbarians defence to give his side a 19-7 half-time lead. The hosts failed to ignite in the second half and, the moment Gear scored his second just after the interval, there was only ever going to be one winner. Lo Cicero, the sole European for the Barbarians, bundled over for a try to briefly curtail the deficit. But the match was blighted by controversy moments later when Justin Marshall, was felled with a high tackle by Jimmy Cowan. Referee Andy Turner waved play on and Casey Laulala coasted in for his side's fifth try. Jermoe Keino and Piri Weepu both added tries to the All Blacks' tally before the final whistle, while van den Bergh gained some consolation for the Baa-Baas. After the match, Barbarians coach Bob Dwyer warned that South African flanker Schalk Burger needed a proper off-season break to maintain his standards. Burger, 21, was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the International Rugby Board, but has struggled for form in recent weeks. \"It's his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season. \"I don't think he's played anywhere near that level on tour,\" he said.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\n>  program.\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,\n   England.  (Sorry, I don't have an ISBN# for this).\n\n2.

By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\n\n--------\n\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\n\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\nsecond derivative.

{"text":" Two high-speed lifts at the world's tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet's fastest.  The lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall TFC 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan. The Guinness Book of Records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on Earth. The lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers' ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.  In total, the TFC Tower has 61 lifts, 34 of them double-deckers, and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. The TFC 101 Tower is due to be officially opened on 31 December.  The super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track. The 17m\/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km\/h). Curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the TFC Tower. The key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include:    - A pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing \"ear popping\"   - An active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - Streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft     \"The certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative Guinness World Records is a great honour for us,\" said Masayuki Shimono, president of manufacturer Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems which installed the lifts. The first record for the world's fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the Guinness Book of Records in 1955. \"As such, it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition, when the record was 426m per minute, or 25.6 km\/h, less than half the speed of the new record,\" said Hein Le Roux, specialist researcher at the Guinness World Records. Taipei's TFC 101 Tower is more than 50m taller than the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - formerly the world's tallest skyscraper. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

It has happened before, and there is reason\nto believe it still goes on.\n\nRead this:\n\nFrom Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\n\nPUBLICATION BAN\n\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\n        being made public.\n\nBy Baruch Me'iri\n\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\nor another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\nwhich may legally not be published\".\n\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\n\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\n\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\naffair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison.  But many\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\nCommunist countries.\n\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\n\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\nLegal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\n\n\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\nprisoner\", asserts MK Zucker.\n\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\n\n\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\nthe mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\n\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\nthe question.  \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\nand its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker.\n\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\nShiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter\".\n\n\"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a\nsuspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\n\n\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\nhappy...\"\n\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \n\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\n\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\nare aware of his imprisonment.\"\n\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the\ndiscretion of the court?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\nthey can misuse.\"\n\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\nmatter being made public.\"\n\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's\narrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \"A healthy\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\npublication may be harmful to state security\".\n\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\nMeir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\n\n\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\n\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \"As a rule, clearly such a\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\nthe most extreme circumstances.\"\n--\nYigal Arens\nUSC\/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\narens@isi.edu\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

The owners put out a statement few days ago, \nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's \na legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an \ninformational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to \nthe game.  So, I think it's good.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think they're moving fast enough?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first \nstep.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \nthat and get cloture?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \npressure not to do it.  \n\t     \n\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \nAmericans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                                 END11:50 A.M. EDT\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Tim Henman's decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.  The world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain's last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told BBC Sport: \"After Tim's announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.\" But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport's premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.  Murray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: \"Now we've dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.\" Britain's next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: \"It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg's growing years. \"I'm confident about the future. I wouldn't lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I'd imagine in five years time we'll be competing for the major honours.\" Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. \"Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim's mantle,\" said Bailey. \"He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he's said in the past.\" Bogdanovic, three years Murray's senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain's Davis Cup umbrella.  While Murray has been marked out as Britain's golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003.

{"text":" Actor Colin Farrell is to make his debut on US television in medical sitcom Scrubs, according to Hollywood newspaper Daily Variety.  The film star, who recently played the title role in historical blockbuster Alexander, will make a cameo appearance as an unruly Irishman. The episode featuring the 28-year-old will be screened on 25 January. Farrell's appearance is said to be a result of his friendship with Zach Braff, who stars in the programme. It will be the actor's first appearance on the small screen since he appeared in BBC series Ballykissangel in 1999. The gentle Sunday night drama came to an end in 2001.  He has since become one of Hollywood's fastest-rising stars, with a string roles in major league films such as Minority Report, Phone Booth and Daredevil. Farrell is pencilled in to play the role of Crockett in a film version of 1980s police drama Miami Vice. Scrubs, which appears on the NBC network in the US and has been shown on Channel 4 on British television, is an off-beat comedy about a group of hospital doctors. Other film stars to have appeared in Scrubs include Heather Graham, while Friends actor Matthew Perry has guest-starred and directed an episode of the show. Its leading star, Zach Braff, has recently been seen on the big screen in Garden State, which he also directed. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent Greek tribunal.  Thanou, 30, was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the Olympics, but the decision was overturned. \"The IAAF will decide if we can compete again in Greece and abroad,\" Thanou told To Vima newspaper in her first interview since the Athens Olympics. \"If given the green light I will run again - that's the only thing I want.\" Thanou, 30, and her compatriot Kostas Kenteris were provisionally suspended by the IAAF in December for missing three drugs tests. The third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics.  But an independent tribunal of the Greek Athletics Federation overturned the provisional ban on 18 March. The IAAF - which said it was \"very surprised\" by the decision of the Greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. However, Dick Pound, the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Authority, has said he will appeal against the decision if the IAAF does not. And Thanou and Kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident. Thanou said: \"I can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse. \"I cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time. I always said we needed a PR person. \"An athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment. \"I am a champion.

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan. The console (12cm by 7.4cm) will play games, movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming. Sony is entering a market which has been dominated by Nintendo for many years.  It launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2.8 million units.

{"text":" Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.  Brian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.  The agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can't understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" For an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  The only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  I would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil. Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. And it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. The debate will rage on, and I'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith. The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts. It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter, who is a canny manager.  The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers. If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary. He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. It's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. If you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. England's game against Holland is a good example. It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson. But you have got to remember Sven-Goran Eriksson's side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played.  The injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress. For the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

I will give my\nreason: because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves, so\nthey deserve some democracy, but Iraqis might not, so they don't.\n\nAs simple as that, whether or not you want to admit it.\n\n>I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an\n>official religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature\n>like it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the\n>ones who rise to power.

The only thing that is common between those people is their concern\nfor the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green\nlight from AMerica (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay\nin power. \n\n\nDo you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things?\nthe ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are\nopposing it.

{"text":" The late US legend Elvis Presley is likely to score his third UK number one single in three weeks on Sunday, according to early sales figures.  The king of rock 'n' roll has already had consecutive chart-toppers with Jailhouse Rock and One Night. A Fool Such As I, the next in a series of 18 reissues, is on course to beat the Chemical Brothers to the top. But his next single, It's Now Or Never, will face a challenge from tsunami charity single Grief Never Grows Old. Sir Cliff Richard, Russell Watson, Boy George, Bill Wyman and members of the Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, America and the Eagles are expected to feature on the charity song.  Bookmakers have offered odds of 10\/1 for all Presley's 18 hits to go back to number one. A Fool Such As I would become the 1,001st number one single in UK chart history after One Night took the 1,000th place on Sunday. The latest release is currently outselling the Chemical Brothers' comeback single Galvanize plus other new releases from Athlete, Ciara and Feeder. Presley's 18 original number ones are being reissued as limited release singles, with fans eager to buy the set to fill a collector's box that went on sale in the first week. Record company Sony BMG is now manufacturing 5,000 more copies of each single than originally planned to meet demand, taking the total number of copies of each song on sale to about 28,000.

Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" The hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.  Often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. But that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. And vice versa. UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has launched its Connected World initiative. The idea, says BT, is to shape a \"21st Century model\" which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together. \"We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology,\" said Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes. He looks after several \"centres of excellence\" which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations, one of which is focused on creative industries.  To mark the initiative's launch, a major international art installation is to open on 15 April in Brussels, with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. They have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. Using a 3D graphics engine, the type commonly used in gaming, Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell have created a virtual, story-based, 3D model of Brussels' Coudenberg Cellars.  They have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of Coudenberg Palace, an historical seat of European power. The 3D world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th Century. \"The river was integral to the city's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared,\" said the artists. \"We hope that by uncovering the river, we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present, and appreciate the flow of modernity, once concealing, but now revealing the River Senne.\" In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine. The game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering, game AI, and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. They are so time-consuming and expensive to create, the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. It was also used in 2003 in Encounter, an urban-based, pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical, on-the-street action. Because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds, new features were added to Tara in order to handle the complex data sets. But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new, and many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.  As more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street, enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance, creativity will become an integral part of technology. The Orange Expressionist exhibition last year, for example, displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the UK to create an interactive installation.  Technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential, not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. Big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. The art world is \"fantastically rich\", said Mr Stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them. Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry brought \u00a321 billion to London alone. It is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to Mr Stone. \"This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online,\" he said. \"It is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem.\" With broadband penetration reaching 100% in the UK, businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. The creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries, or more patent ideas for tech companies. \"What we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking. \"We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy,\" said Mr Stone.

{"text":" Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side.  \"We had the initiative but it wasn't easy. It was a professional sort of performance,\" the Dutchman said. \"Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried.\" Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: \"Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult.\" However, he added that his side, who are four places above the Magpies in the Premiership, were \"not afraid of anyone\". Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match. \"They're on a high, but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win,\" he said.  He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. \"It wasn't the best display but it's all about the result,\" the Irishman said. \"We knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions. The pitch wasn't the best but we still tried to pass it. \"We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come.\" Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance. \"If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team,\" he said. \"If we defend in the Championship like we did we'll not get another point. \"We were organised but I felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn't look like scoring.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

This is best achieved\n   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.\n   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)\n\n3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.\n\nOK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC\nwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.\n\nI want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync\npulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting\nthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.\n\nThere are 2 reasons for doing this\n\n1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're\n   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.\n\n2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the\n   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my\n   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,\n   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.\n   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA\n   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,\n   I can get down to 1.\n\nUltimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,\nbut I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...\n\n\n\n--\nAlan Brown\ndogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" One person in the UK is joining the internet's fast lane every 10 seconds, according to BT.  The telecoms giant said the number of people on broadband via the telephone line had now surpassed four million. Including those connected via cable, almost six million people have a fast, always-on connection. The boom has been fuelled by fierce competition and falling prices, as well as the greater availability of broadband over the phone line. \"The take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace,\" said Ben Verwaayen, BT's chief executive. \"We will be in a very strong position to hit our five million target by summer 2006 much earlier than we had previously expected.\"  The last million connections were made over the past four months, with thousands of people being added to the total every day of the week.  Those signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. According to BT, more than 95% of UK homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line. It aims to extend this figure to 99.4% by next summer. There are also an estimated 1.7 million cable broadband customers in the UK. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Johnny O'Connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his RBS Six Nations debut for Ireland against Scotland on Saturday.  The Wasps flanker replaces Denis Leamy but O'Connor knows that the Munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against England. \"It's a 'horses for courses' selection really,\" said O'Connor. \"There's a lot of competition here and I can't just drag my heels around if I don't get picked.\" It looks a definite head-to-head battle between himself and 23-year-old Leamy - three stone heavier than O'Connor - for the number seven role against the world champions. Nonetheless, all O'Connor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap.  \"Missing the Italian game was disappointing certainly, but you can't dwell on these things - it's part and parcel of rugby. \"Denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity. \"It's a good situation to be in if there are good players around you, pushing for a place in the side.\" O'Connor, who celebrated his 25th birthday on Wednesday, was touted by Wasps director of rugby Warren Gatland as a possible 2005 Lions Test openside as far back as last September. And his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of O'Sullivan's mind for the Scottish tussle. O'Connor added: \"It will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed, with the new laws having come in.  \"Obviously the breakdown a big part of what I do on the pitch so I'm hoping to hold some influence there against what is a very solid Scottish pack.\" O'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.

{"text":" British Telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers.  The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL. Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. The new speeds start to come into effect on 17 February for home customers and 1 April for businesses. \"Britain is now broadband Britain,\" said Duncan Ingram, BT's managing director, broadband and internet services. He added: \"Ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed.  \"These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections,\" he said. Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram. Despite the increases, BT will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. \"The allowances are extremely generous,\" said Mr Ingram \"For what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue.\" BT will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. Customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. BT now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. In the last few months, many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services, including AOL, Plusnet and UK Online.  But Britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially Japan and South Korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40Mbps. But Mr Ingram said it was important to \"separate hype from reality\". He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps. Customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 February. Mr Ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  Hugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

(Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't\nbelieve you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is\nrelevant.)\n   \n>Acquiring weapons in Norway:\n>You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a \n>permit, and a good reason to get the permit....\n>If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from \n>the police and to be a member of a gun-club.\n\n       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of\nRKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is\nthat it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.\nIt discriminates against the poor.\n\n       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what\nconditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection\nif you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular\nbasis or have been threatened.)\n\n>The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and\/or\n>records of SERIOUS mental diseases.\n\n       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among\ngun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\ncontain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\nif you qualify in every way.\n\n>Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun\n>-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.\n>It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???\n>You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\n\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\na driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. \n\n       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\nfrom the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\npast legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \n\n>Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):\n>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'\n>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\n>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \n>time befor the crime.\n>\n>Use of knives:\n>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.\n>You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\n>in public -rigth ??\n\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\nas from one country in Europe to another).\n\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \n\n>Individual vs masses:\n>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\n>extent....\n>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\n>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \n>all the others ??\n\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \nthe rights of some other group.  \n\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd\nhave a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's\nrights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\nby one.\n\n>The issue:\n>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\n\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\n\n>We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\n>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\n>But should it have to be like that ??\n\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\nBut currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\n\n>Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\n\n       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state\nmay enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\n   \n>If you believe it's smart\/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\n>it should be free to buy guns ??\n\n       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently\nimplemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\ndrivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is\nnecessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody\nelse killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year\nold will have picked up riding around in his parents car.\n\n       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

{"text":"From: zyeh@caspian.usc.edu (zhenghao yeh)\nSubject: Ellipse from Its Offset\n\n\nHi! Everyone,\n\nSince some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from\n4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse\nfrom its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find\nthe original ellipse analytically?\n\nI spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,\nbut I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear\nprogramming technique to deal with this problem approximately.\n\nAny ideas will be greatly appreciated.

{"text":"From: dotsonm@dmapub.dma.org (Mark Dotson)\nSubject: Fragmentation\n\n\nThe primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\"\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\n\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\nthe Scriptures.\n\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\n\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\n\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\n\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\n\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\n\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\n\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.\n\n                                 Mark\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Daniela Hantuchova moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating Elene Likhotseva of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces Serena Williams.  Australian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia's Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed. Davenport defeated China's Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt. American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2. Myskina will face eighth-seed Patty Schnyder from Switzerland, who defeated China's Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card Sania Mirza of India against Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.  Before her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game. \"I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle,\" she said. Williams was also far from content. \"I don't know what I was doing there,\" she said. \"It was really windy and I hadn't played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here.\" But Hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. \"I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts,\" she said. \"It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

It is \n   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\n   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \n   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\n\nI agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is\nnot terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.\n\n   [snip]\n   imagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\n\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\nprior to the invasion. \n\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\n\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\n\n   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\n\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\nthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\nit and prevent further attacks.\n\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\n   would have resulted in.  \n\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\n\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\n\nNo, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\n\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\n\n--\nShai Guday              | Stealth bombers,\nOS Software Engineer    |\nThinking Machines Corp. |\tthe winged ninjas of the skies.\nCambridge, MA           |\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}
{"text":" Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.  The home side's Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.  Maloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.

Or I should say, and more to my original \npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\n\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\n        evidence (your way)\n\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it\n        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence \n\tand it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can\n        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't\n\tmuch to say.\n\nDo you agree?\n\n-- \n jim halat         halat@bear.com     \nbear-stearns       --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you--\n   nyc             i speak only for myself\n\n\n\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" The permanent replacement for late DJ John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot.  Rock DJ Huw Stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every Tuesday, with black music champion Ras Kwame on Wednesdays and dance DJ Rob Da Bank on Thursdays. Rob Da Bank filled in after Peel had a heart attack aged 65 in October. All three will play \"diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial\" songs under the banner of the OneMusic show.  Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. The three DJs were chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\", the station said.  Rob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales. And Ras Kwame is host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1's digital station 1Xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage. Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave. She will host the lunchtime show on Saturdays from this week.  Good luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it's probably a good idea to get them all contributing. This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed.  Very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel. Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name. Congratulations!  The whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre. He played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. Bring back Steve Lamacq.  The obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.com. This lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in British broadcasting today. Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel. BBC Radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).  America's former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. The 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer. The sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the CAS has upheld USADA's findings. \"The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone\/epitestosterone cream and THG,\" said a CAS statement. \"Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time.\" So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal. World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.  Drug enforcement chiefs in the US have vowed to crack down on cheats. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that. \"The CAS panel's decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA's ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free,\" said Madden. The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results. The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. The trial is expected to open next March. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be\nwhat I am doing while reading this group.\n\nIts a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\nthanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A\/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis & Clark College\nPortland\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

I really doubt all of those\noccur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \"self-inflicted\ngunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\" is probably\nwell under 250 per year.\n\n>>If you fall, for example,\n>> and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow, the gun will discharge.\n\nHandguns designs have included a \"hammer block\" since around 1960\nor earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates\nthe cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun\ncannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and\nis pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,\nmodern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or \nin some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) \n\n>> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of\n>> deaths caused by animal attacks or \"wacko\" attacks combined.\n\nI don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders \neach year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only\n2.1% of the murders were killings by \"wacko\"s, you would be\nwrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated\nassaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and \npreventing them, thousands of times more significant than the\naccidents you are worried about.\n\n(These figures, by the way, are from the FBI's \"Uniform Crime\nReport\" for 1990.

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\na breakaway to salt away the game).  There\nis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the\nvictory. \n\nIn my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as\nLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \n\nGary\n\nGo Sabres!\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.  Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words \"Stay tuned\". No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.  Lycos Europe's \"Make love not spam\" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. But the plan has proved controversial.  Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.  The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, \"Stay tuned\". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. \"Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,\" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. \"Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: ken@wybbs.mi.org \nSubject: *** CONSUMER WARNING ***  MidWest Micro (Ohio)\n\nThinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.\nUnless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want\nto trade elsewhere.\n\nDespite the fact that they answer the phone, \"Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're\nhaving a GREAT Day!\", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return\na modem that didn't work as I expected it to.\n\nThe details:\n\nI ordered one of their house brand \"Infotel\" 14.4\/DF internal FAX modems.\nIn reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over\nthe name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not\nhave ordered it, had I known this in advance.\n\nIt arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was\npreconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.\n\nFor several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1\/COM2. At the\ntime I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.\n\nAlthough the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or\n14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After\nspending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested\ndisabling the COM2 port.\n\nThis appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long\nterm solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both\nwould not be in use at the same time as the modem.\n\nI called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail \nhell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I \nwas then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they \ndidn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.\n\nI called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA\nnumber. She promptly switched me to a \"Tech Support\" rep that implied that\nit was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA\nnumber. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I\nwas not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does\nnot work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more \nthan the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local\ncharitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered\na Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.\n\nFor $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know \nwill support their users and sold by a company (based on personal\nexperience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have\nknown better...\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

Ramsey inherited it from Mike\nFoligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy\nRuff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who\nretired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?\nAfter all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.\nJim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in\nreverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm\nnot sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit\nand Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith\nseems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if\nthe captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he\nplayed for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)\n\nCaptaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,\nunless you're a franchise player.\n\n-- \nValerie Hammerl\t\t\tBirtday -(n)- An event when friends get \nhammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu\ttogether, set your dessert on fire, then\nacscvjh@ubms.cc.buffalo.edu\tlaugh and sing while you frantically try \nv085pwwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu  to blow it out.  \n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Sony's Playstation Portable is the top gadget for 2005, according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine.  It beats the iPod into second place in the Top Ten Essentials list which predicts what gadget-lovers are likely to covet this year. Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back \u00a37,455. That is \u00a31,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable.  Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox.  \"What this year's Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper, sexier and more indispensable than ever. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology,\" said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. The proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks Mr Vaughan. \"Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?\" he asks. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts. The Xbox 2, high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006, it says. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans.

The two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of England's current slump. \"We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them. \"England have not been having the best of championships. That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,\" he said. But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London. Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. Kirwan said: \"The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. \"But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England.\" England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson's kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland's line.  But centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats. \"We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,\" he said. \"We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. \"We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game. We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win.\" England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson. His predecessor, Sir Clive Woodward, began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time\/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits\/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits\/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"\/\"medium\"\/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet\/news.answers\/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet\/news.answers\/ftp-list\/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib\/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib\/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS\/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub\/jpeg\/viewers\/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386\/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG\/GIF\/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos\/graphics\/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS\/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning\/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/gif\/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos\/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"\/pub\/msdos\/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file \/pub\/bryanw\/pc\/jpeg\/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos\/windows3\/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS\/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check \/pub\/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n\/pub\/os2\/all\/graphics\/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS\/2 1.x.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion\/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS\/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG\/GIF\/BMP\/Targa\/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11\/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT\/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT\/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer\/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT\/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/art\/gif\/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG\/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/qt.1.0.stuff\/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer\/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/app\/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under \/mirrors\/amiga.physik.unizh.ch\/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer\/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/edit\/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga\/os30\/gfx\/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG\/ILBM\/GIF\/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/show\/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga\/gfx\/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file \/atari\/Graphics\/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file \/atari\/Graphics\/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read\/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\nNeXT:\n\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in \/pub\/next (both are\ncurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\ndoes not support JPEG.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory \/graphics\/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos\/graphics\/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM\/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n\/pub\/usenet\/news.answers\/compression-faq\/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF\/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF\/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF\/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression\/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression\/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1\/2 or 1\/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1\/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte's statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.  \"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport's ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte's allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Gamers have bought almost all of the first batch of Sony's new PlayStation Portable (PSP) games console, which went on sale in Japan on Sunday.  Thousands of people queued for hours to get hold of one of the 200,000 PSPs which were shipped to retailers. The handheld console can play games, music and movies and goes on sale in Europe and North America next year. Despite the demand Sony said it would not increase the 500,000-strong stock of PSPs it plans to ship by year's end.  Sony says it intends to ship three million of the consoles by March 2005. The company is hoping to challenge the dominance of Nintendo in the handheld market. Nintendo released its new DS console earlier this year and has already raised shipment targets for the device by 40%. The PSP is selling in Japan for 19,800 yen ($188; \u00a398) while Nintendo's DS console sells in the US and Japan for $150 (\u00a378). Nintendo's goal is to ship 5 million of its new Nintendo DS handheld consoles by March 2005. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" The body that represents the US movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing, aimed at parents.  The Movie Association for America's (MPAA) free Parent File Scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs. It will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. Parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. The MPAA said files found would not be passed on to it. \"Our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files,\" said Dan Glickman, MPAA chief. \"Many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they've downloaded it from.\"  But some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified Windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. Movie piracy cost the industry \u00a33.7bn ($7bn) in 2003, according to analysts. The MPAA said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat \"the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software, including such common problems as viruses, Trojan horses and identity theft\".  Mr Glickman said that the film industry was embracing \"digital age technologies\", like Movielink and CinemaNow, which are legal movie sites. \"But legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive,\" he added. The industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the US, but did not say how many were being sued. Its first set of lawsuits were filed in November 2004. It also started a campaign against operators of BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect peer-to-peer networks. The first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the US in January. William Trowbridge and Michael Chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been dropped from France's squad for the Six Nations match with Ireland in Dublin on 12 March.  Harinordoquy was a second-half replacement in last Saturday's 24-18 defeat to Wales. Bourgoin lock Pascal Pape, who has recovered from a sprained ankle, returns to the 22-man squad. Wing Cedric Heymans and Ludovic Valbon come in for Aurelien Rougerie and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude.  Rougerie hurt his chest against Wales while Grandclaude was a second-half replacement against both England and Wales. Valbon, capped in last June's Tests against the United States and Canada, was a second half replacement in the win over Scotland.  France coach Bernard Laporte said Harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend. \"Imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least I can say is that he didn't make a thundering comeback against Wales,\" said Laporte. \"We know the Ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed, and Gregory Lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight. \"The Grand Slam is gone but we'll go to Ireland to win. \"It will be a very exciting game because Ireland have three wins under their belt, have just defeated England and have their eyes set on a Grand Slam.\" France, who lost to Wales last week, must defeat the Irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the Six Nations trophy. Ireland are unbeaten in this year's tournament and have their sights set on a first Grand Slam since 1948.

What \nwas he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't \nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \nthe government--why my husband was killed.\n\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\nHe doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we \nlived. I say, \"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\" He looked \nagain and said, \"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \nmany people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \nyou can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \"Down with the \nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's \naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \ncan't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \nAnd my son says, \"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \ndidn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \nsimply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what's going on, what \nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what \nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \neach second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their \nheads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \ndon't know.\n\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \ndear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \nyou afraid of, they're just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \nVocational School. \"Don't fear,\" he said, \"it's nothing, nothing all that \nbad.\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \nWhen I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and \nthere and I said, \"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don't be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting\ndifferent things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \"You speak\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\" He says \"Close the window\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it's\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \nThings had calmed down slightly.\n\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \nget up.\" I say, \"Today's my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren't you going \nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \nyou going?\" He says, \"I'm going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \noutside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to\nme, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\n\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\nit was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I\nsaid, \"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\"\n\nTires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm \nstanding on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \nthey've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \no'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten\no'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \nI'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \ndon't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\n\"look what they're doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \ninside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They've killed\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without \nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \ngo to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my \ndaughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \nand went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \nhere, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, \nand I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \nUncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the \ngarage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \nEmma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for \nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \nI'm coming too.\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \nhere with us, I'm go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \nEmma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's \nthere . . . wheezing.\"\n\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don't go near him, \nor we'll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and \nsaid, \"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \nAlik, maybe he'll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\n\nI went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \nthere, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still \nlying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\nwindow until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\no'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don't\ngo out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\nalive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\"\n\nAt six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \nwanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They\nsaid, \"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\"\n\nIt's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\" Now Shagen \njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they've \nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \ndead . . . he's alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\" \nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, \nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes \nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \nlike that there was no hope left.\n\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \npeople.\n\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa's been killed.\"\n\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \nyes, that's our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor's office\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We're taking care of all that,\ndon't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\nsays, \"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just\none second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\nlike a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\"\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli\nSadukhov.\n\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \nhospital until the 4th.\n\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let's go.\" And the women, our \ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They're going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\nstill can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let's \ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can't look, no.\"\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\" He says, \n\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\nbeen injured at work . . .\n\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \ndown, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \nwe've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\n\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform \nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \nget here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\"\n\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I'm \nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \narson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone \nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\nsays, \"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \nif it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\n\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you're \ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \n\"Yes.\" \"And now you're telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \nforgot!\" Like that.\n\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What's your nationality?\" He \nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he's an\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too \n. . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \nthat's where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\n\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\nwere taken. He says he didn't take them\n\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\nit, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \nhave the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\nI didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven't straightened \neverything out, I think that's unjust.\"\n\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\npercent of his body . . .\n\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \nArmy. And now they're fatherless...\n\nI couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\nyears' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' \ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\ncreep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn't a \nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\n\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\" I \nstill don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\ndon't understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\nanswer . . .

{"text":"From: rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com\nSubject: \"Ex-Gays?\" (follow-up)\n\nI would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.\n\nIn retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.\nHaldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_\n\nTHERAPY INEFFECTIVE\n\nRecently the founders of yet another prominent \"ex-gay\" ministry, Exodus\nInternational, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.\nMichael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers\nfor 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.\n\nThank you.\nPAX\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Oasis singer Liam Gallagher has been fined 50,000 euros (\u00a335,000) after a fight in a German hotel two years ago.  Gallagher was arrested along with drummer Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage after the brawl in Munich in December 2002. The band said they were victims of an \"unprovoked attack\" in a nightclub. But police said Gallagher kicked an officer in the chest and had large amounts of alcohol and drugs - possibly cocaine - in his blood. Gallagher lost two front teeth in the fight, which led to the band abandoning their German tour. His brother and bandmate Noel was in bed at the time.  \"The process has stopped by paying 50,000 euros,\" said Anton Winkler, spokesman for the Munich prosecutor. At the time, police said a \"physical altercation\" broke out among the musicians at about 0200 local time. That led to one of the group being \"jostled\" and falling onto the table of five Italian guests - causing the fight, they said. The fight continued outside, where \"one of the officers was kicked in the chest with full force by Liam Gallagher... and suffered minor injuries\", they said. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests.  A quarter of broadband users in Britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by UK think-tank Demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the UK have broadband and that number is growing fast.  The Demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web.  More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online. It found that one in five post something on the net everyday, ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs. \"Broadband is putting the 'me' in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual,\" said John Craig, co-author of the Demos report. \"From self-diagnosis to online education, broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed.\" The Demos report, entitled Broadband Britain: The End Of Asymmetry?, was commissioned by net provider AOL. \"Broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the UK,\" said Karen Thomson, Chief Executive of AOL UK, \"with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio.\" According to analysts Nielsen\/\/NetRatings, more than 50% of the 22.8 million UK net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed They spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections, viewing an average of 1,444 pages per month. The popularity of fast net access is growing, partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" US rap duo OutKast's trio of trophies at the MTV Europe Awards crowns a year of huge success for the band.  The latest triumph adds to the three Grammys and four American MTV gongs won earlier in this year. Andre 3000 and Big Boi's album Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world. The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot. The Georgia pair's year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all?  G Money, a presenter on the BBC's urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests. \"They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects. \"Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business,\" says the DJ.  \"But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD. \"Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below. We haven't seen the last of them,\" he adds. OutKast's musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum. But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US.  1Xtra's G Money says it took the latest album, released in 2003, for him to be \"assured of their genius\". \"They have always been experimental, some of it has worked and some hasn't,\" he adds. But G Money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough. \"What can you do next when you've done it all?\" he says. With ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame, it seems that OutKast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Hollywood film star Liam Neeson has held a dinner party in New York to promote Belfast's Lyric Theatre.  The Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a \"very dilapidated condition\". Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of \u00a38m is the only answer. Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of \"healthy, wealthy Irish Americans\" in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.  The Oscar-nominated actor, whose films include Schindler's List, Michael Collins and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, said: \"The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. \"It gave me a start professionally. Mary O'Malley, the founder of the theatre, gave me my future. \"In those days, in the mid-70s, when I was there, we were doing a play every four weeks. \"Belfast was not a pretty town to be living in. \"There was serious trouble, as you know, but this theatre was like a Belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week, doing everything from Shakespeare to Yeats to O'Casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do.\" The Lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the Stranmillis embankment overlooking the River Lagan in 1968.  As well as Liam Neeson, it also launched the careers of Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea and playwrights such as Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York's SoHo House, Mr Neeson said that his spirit belonged to the Glens of Antrim. And he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - Ian Paisley. He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a \"very dynamic, extraordinary figure\". Neeson used to listen to his sermons on a Friday night in Ballymena. He said: \"What an orator. He was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness. But it was so dramatic. I found him very powerful. \"I'd love to get a chance to play him some time.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" It's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in two.  It's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Peter Parker. Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina make this compelling. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects. This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.  Sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.  Now is that a Christmas present or what? Give this to someone on 24 December and you won't see them again until early in the New Year. It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier films: there's no True Grit, for instance, though there is Hellraisers. The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.  It was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on DVD. This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. But it's also a disappointment. The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. That's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said on Wednesday.  The match will include players from the Lions tour of New Zealand. \"The Australian Rugby Union has thrown its support behind a proposed North-South match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals,\" the ARU said. The date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is Sydney's Olympic Stadium. ARU chief executive Gary Flowers said the world cricket charity match in Melbourne earlier this month had inspired the ARU. \"We still need to discuss the options with the IRB (International Rugby Board), the Lions and our SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia Rugby) partners, but June or July is seen as a better option than March to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available,\" he said. Wallabies captain George Gregan said the charity match was a \"great initiative\". Tri-Nations rivals Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of Six Nations teams France, Ireland, England, Wales, Italy and Scotland. Coach Clive Woodward's Lions squad will tour New Zealand in June and July, including Tests on 25 June, 2 and 9 July.  Almost 80,000 fans packed into Melbourne Cricket Ground on 10 January for a charity match that raised \u00a35.9m for victims of the Asian tsunami. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

But\n>everyone else needs to wake up and realize that being unfair right back is\n>disgusting, racist and sexist.\n>\n>Why can't we learn to treat everyone fairly, without generalizing?  What\n>stupidity gene makes this so difficult?  \"I'd like to buy the world a\n>clue...\"\n\n\n\tThe word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \"B\"\nword, or the \"H\" word, or even the \"N\" or \"W\" words. It is the \"L\" word -\nLOSER !!\n\n\tThat's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\n\n\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\n(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had\nit so good. \n\n\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\ndoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\ndiscourse about people who \"don't get it\". For those of us in the winning\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \nsuggestion of losing.\n\n\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three\nyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \nweapon of choice these days. \n\t\n\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \nsure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\n\n\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \n\n\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \nminority.\n\n\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care\nwho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\nthe pot.\n\n\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to \nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \npreference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of \nthem be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl\nsomeday)\n\n\n\nBill R.\n\n--\n\n\"The only proposals in the Senate that I         \"My opinions do not represent\nhave seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer or\npraiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency.\"\nIt seems to me that the historian's foremost     - Bill Riggs\nduty is to ensure that virtue is remembered,\nand to deter evil words and deeds with the\nfear of posterity's damnation.\"\n- Tacitus, _Annals_ III. 65\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

The Belfast-born, Glasgow-based band collected the prizes at the ceremony at Dublin's Point Theatre. Westlife won the award for best Irish pop act, voted for by the public, beating former member Brian McFadden. Franz Ferdinand picked up best international band and album while Paddy Casey collected best Irish male. Singer-songwriter Casey beat Brian McFadden and Damien Rice. Juliette Turner was named best Irish female.  In the international categories, Morrissey beat Eminem, Usher and Robbie Williams to best male while PJ Harvey pipped Kylie Minogue, Joss Stone, Anastacia and Natasha Bedingfield to the female crown. The 8,000 fans at the ceremony were treated to performances from US rapper Snoop Dogg, Brian McFadden with Delta Goodrem and The Thrills featuring Rolling Stones star Ronnie Wood. Snow Patrol's success came after a year in which they made a chart breakthrough with their third album Final Straw. \"I think a lot of bands should go through a wee bit of a kicking before the make a success,\" singer Gary Lightbody and drummer Jonny Quinn said. \"It has been good for us, but also hard for us over the past six years.\" Snow Patrol will support U2 on their European tour later this year - but U2 were not nominated for best Irish band and album.

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\n\nOK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\nGod's purposes.\n\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \n\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \nJesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \nGod's Law.\n\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \nLaw in this way:\n\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \nin Christ Jesus.\n\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \nserved it's purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \nas Christ said he would do.\n\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ\/Man, Jesus, are the same\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\nre-expressed in Christianity. \n\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \nrepresenting Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\nThe Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\nActs 20:7)\n\nOK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\n\nPlease excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read \nthis far...\n\nJohn Nunnally\nNunnally@acs.Harding.edu\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}
{"text":" Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.  Academics from the Institute of Education at London University found that \"games literacy\" was a key skill for youngsters. As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say. Pupils should also be able to create their own games, they say.  \"Like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,\" said project manager Caroline Pelletier.  \"Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,\" she said. The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. \"Without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be, they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity,\" said research fellow Diane Carr.  The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. Sixth-form teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, TV and popular music at the A-level course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge.  For parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy. Dr Andrew Burn, associate director of the Institute of Education's Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents. \"Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do,\" he said. \"But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games.\" The games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. \"At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural, social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently,\" said Roger Bennett, director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association. \"This report is further evidence, if it were needed, about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming. They have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career.\" The three-year research project, which is being presented at a seminar on Tuesday in London, was partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry.

Take the plane\ncontaining this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any\nplane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles\nto the ABC one.\n\nLet E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference\nof the ABC circle which lies in this plane.

(Flames to \/dev\/null)\n\n--------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------\n\n\t\t\tTHE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT\n\n\t\t\t      by J. Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

If he were alive today and I could\n> \n> Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n> Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents\n> have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? \n\nMr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything\nwritten in every \"historical\" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \n\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\ncarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\n\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\n\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\n\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\n\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\n\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\n\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\n\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\n\t...\n\tI call to you, my father Amun,\n\tI am among a host of strangers;\n\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\n\tI am alone, there's none with me!\n\t...\n\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\n\tAmun is more helpful than they;\n\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\n\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\n\n\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\n\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\n\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n\tHe called from behind as if near by:\n\t\"Forward, I am with you,\n\tI your father, my hand is with you,\n\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\n\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n\t...\n\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\n\tNot one looked behind him,\n\tNot one turned around,\n\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\n\t...\n\tOne called out to the other saying:\n\t\"No man is he who is among us,\n\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\n\tThey are of one who is unique,\n\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n\tCome quick, flee before him,\n\tTo seek life and breathe air;\n\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\n\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\n\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\n\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\n> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\n> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\n> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n\t hooey?\"\n\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAbraham Lincoln\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \n\t\t\t\t\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

Go back and\n>   review the HISTORY.  \n\nIf a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky.\nDid you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? \nBefore 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, \ndrove all the Turks\/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,\nanyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the \nNazis.\n\n \"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously\n  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,\n  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and \n  anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\"[1]\n\n[1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' \n    Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.\n  \nAs a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) \nwas the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in\nBoston (where ASALA\/SDPA\/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but \nhad followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally\nTzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect\nof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian\nwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.\nIn 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central\nCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the \nAmerican-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local\nArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\n\n \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\n  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\"[1]\n\n[1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \"The\n    Armenian Displaced Persons,\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,\n    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.\n\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12\/6\/'92\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

{"text":" Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has been praised by police for \"very courageously\" tackling a burglar who stole jewellery from his house.  The singer grabbed an intruder who then jumped 30ft (10m) from a first floor window as the star gave chase at his Buckinghamshire home on Monday. \"I acted on impulse,\" Osbourne said. \"In hindsight, it could have been a lot worse. It could've got really ugly.\" A \u00a3100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to a conviction. His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept.  The heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999. \"I could have been badly injured or shot or anything,\" Osbourne said. \"I just thank God that no-one got injured.\" He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt. \"I wouldn't want anyone to get injured.\" The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: \"Is the Pope a Catholic?\" The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter. Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. \"Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,\" he said. Ozzy said he was \"just coming to grips\" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.  \"We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I'm very disappointed.\" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items. They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. \"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that's where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\".  A daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who \"hasn't worked and wants to take what's yours\". \"But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we've got we have worked our arses off for.\" \"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that's my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife's colon cancer, their childrens' drug problems and now the burglary.  On Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John's partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5' 10\" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice. Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed. Police appealed for public help to find the perpetrators and stolen items on 0845 8 505 505 or 0800 555 111. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition.

If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\n\n                                                  Frank Crary\n                                                  CU Boulder\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

If a scientist creates a unique living creature\n#(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the\n#right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?\n\nDear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,\nbut that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there\nare respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\nGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (\"I\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\n\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\n\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\n\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\n#\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.

{"text":"From: dtate+@pitt.edu (David M. Tate)\nSubject: MVP '92 Revisited\n\nTim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\nperformances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\n\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \n\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National\nLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.\n\n\tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal\n\n\tSandberg\t  44\t\t  32\t\t 76\n\tBonds\t\t  67\t\t   3\t\t 70\n\tWalker\t\t  26\t\t  26\t\t 52\n\tJustice\t\t  14\t\t  33\t\t 47\n\tDaulton\t \t  44\t\t  ??\t\t 44+?\n\tLarkin\t\t  36\t\t   4\t\t 40\n\tGrace\t\t  13\t\t  27\t\t 40\n\nAs I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.\nIf you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you\nget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\nwouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\nand I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case \ncould be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.\n\nMy personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.\n\n\nIn the American League:\n\n\tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal\n\n\tVentura\t\t  22\t\t  34\t\t 56\n\tMartinez\t  47\t\t  -1\t\t 46\n\tB. Anderson \t  21\t\t  25\t\t 46\n\tThomas\t\t  47\t\t  -5\t\t 42\n\tR. Henderson\t  25\t\t  16\t\t 41\n\tRaines\t\t  17\t\t  23\t\t 40\n\tTettleton\t  33\t\t  ??\t\t 33+?\n\nOK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top\nplayer in the AL last year?  I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time\narguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only\napproximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\n\nOnce again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\na guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.\n\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\n\n\tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\n\nI'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\nbalanced offensive\/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\nleverage in W\/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\nnegative defense.\n\nFor the record:\n\n\tCarlos Baerga\t\t  27\t\t  5\t\t  32\n\tRoberto Alomar\t\t  35\t\t -2\t\t  33\n\nForget it; it's a wash.\n\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\nDon Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his\nweak '90 and '91 to end up with\n\n\tMattingly\t\t  -1\t\t  17\t\t  16 runs\n\nwhich is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runs\nbehind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John\nOlerud.  On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and\nevery other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.\n\n-- \n   David M.

Loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. Now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multi-channel TV. Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners. Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs. \"Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card,\" said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher.  Viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley. Credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies, gambling and gaming. \"The idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. It will be down to the ingenuity of the content players,\" said Mr Whalley. For the BBC, revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to Freeview set-top boxes, said Mr Whalley. Currently most Freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard. Some 7.4 million households have Sky boxes and Sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010. Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims.  The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage. However, DEC has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.  The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads \"Urgent Tsunami Earthquake Appeal\" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. The web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. Patricia Sanders, spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down. She said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. It is thought that the fake site is being run from Romania. Ms Sanders said DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.  DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said.  Ms Sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not DEC's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. All attempts by the BBC News website to contact the people behind the site have failed. None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. This is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. One e-mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands. The con was very similar to the familiar Nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. In a monthly report anti-virus firm Sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during January. Another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program. Anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: king@cogsci.ucsd.edu (Jonathan King)\nSubject: teams as organisms; stats or \"stats\" (was Re: Jack Morris)\n\nNote:  I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,\nbut as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\nI want to say.\n\nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:\n>But the point is that the only decision making pro-\n>cess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\n>lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\n>inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\n>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nThere's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\nteam and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\n\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto 'humans', and \"organ Z\" onto\n'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'\nabove might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\n\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\n\n>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\n>solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\n>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\n\n>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\n>criteria, then fine.\n\nIn this cases, we're seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\n\n>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\n>individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\n\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\nit's unclear what it all really means.\n\n***\n\nNow just one more un-related point:\n\n>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a\n>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference\nbetween the winners and the losers.\n\nMoreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\n\n>The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new\n>knowledge being produced.  \n\nSince stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\neven though I'm relying on stats to do it.\n\njking\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26\/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

The United States\n delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came \n to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, \n their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation\n was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed\n by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns\n before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped\n that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of \n February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region\n of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According\n to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the\n aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,\n many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women\n have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who\n were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the\n mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity \n and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the\n Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order \n to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities \n committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims\n be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,\n and honour of the Muslims be protected.\"\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

{"text":" Microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new Xbox 2 console.  Some details of the Xbox's performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.  Microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. However, during his keynote speech at GDC Mr Allard, who heads development of game-making tools for the console, gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. He said gaming was entering a \"high-definition\" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear.  Industry watchers took this to mean that the Xbox 2 will push for HDTV quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. This interface will hold details of a player's statistics and skill level on a \"gamer card\" as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for, said Mr Allard. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. \"Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force,\" he said.

{"text":" Adam Jones says the Wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful France pack in Paris.  The prop said: \"If we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it. \"The mentality of the French is 'scrum, scrum, scrum'. We will see how good France are and the scrum is the key. \"I just hope [the backs] carry on where they left off against Italy. It's just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity.\" Wales have won two of their last three visits to Stade de France, having secured back-to-back wins under Graham Henry in 1999 and 2001. And with the likes of Shane Williams and Gavin Henson finding top form at the right time, Mike Ruddock's team is now one of international rugby's most potent attacking threats. \"Gavin is ridiculously talented. He has been bouncing around the place this week, so he is up for it,\" warned Jones.  France have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one-dimensional play in their victories over Scotland and France. Captain Fabien Pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair, but stressed the game with be won or lost up front. The lock believes the Welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line-out, but Jones insisted his fellow front-row colleagues have nothing to fear.  \"Gethin [Jenkins] won't be intimidated tomorrow, none of us will,\" said Jones, who will be facing France for the first time. \"We will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs. \"Me and Gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of Mefin's experience in there. \"Mefin is a good thinker who puts things across. But what is the saying? If you are good enough you are old enough and Gethin certainly is. \"He is a really good player and I imagine he will be on the Lions tour [to New Zealand this summer].\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

The insults you have seen quoted thus\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's \nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\nOne wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all\nthis.\n\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\n\t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.\n\nPeter Nyikos\n\n\n\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" This won't go down as one of the greatest marathons of Paula's career. But as a test of character, it was the toughest race she's ever taken part in.  A win in the New York marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. If Paula's last experience of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. She can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. Even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. She knows she can dig deep if she needs to. It was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. And although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of Paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course.  I was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. She thought that if she won, people would say \"why couldn't she do that in Athens?\" And if she lost, people would say her career was over. And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens. But that was never on the cards. She might have been beaten, but she would have kept running. The reasons she was forced to pull out in Athens - the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren't at play here. The only question was what position she could finish in. Most important of all, despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were never doubts in Paula's mind. If she wasn't confident, she wouldn't have run. After all, if you're the best in the world at an event, you'll always have expectations of winning.  Now Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

ESPN had\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\nnight).\n\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.

{"text":" The Office's Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.  Gervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret. He will also write a part for himself in the episode. \"I've got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career. The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time,\" he said. Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: \"Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it's one of the best shows on TV in the last decade.\" Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.  In winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original.

In April \n1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A \nnumber of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas.\"\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\n\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\n[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900\n    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg\n    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.\n\n\nThe establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored\nby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August \n1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of\nRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.\n\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

To permanently reorder (to \nuse the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records \nappropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)\nexporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach \ndatabase), and then copying the exported files back to the original \nfilename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really \nlike about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than \nthe loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).

The singer must serve 15 days in prison after he consistently swore during a concert in St Thomas, Jamaica, in January despite warnings by police. He was charged under a law which prohibits indecent dress or expression. Sizzla's five-date UK tour was cancelled last November after protests by gay rights campaigners.  Sizzla, whose real name is Miguel Collins, has released 25 albums since 1995 and is credited with taking dancehall music back to its reggae origins. Many Jamaican entertainers have appeared before the courts for use of profanity in recent years but they usually receive a verbal warning, a suspended sentence or community service. Sizzla's UK tour was cancelled after Scotland Yard's Racial and Violent Crime taskforce announced it was examining lyrics by eight reggae artists. It would not confirm that Sizzla was among them. One of his most controversial songs, Pump Up, contains the Jamaican patois lyrics \"fire fi di man dem weh go ride man behind\", translated by gay rights group OutRage! as \"burn the men who have sex with men\".

The assertion\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\nexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought\nin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the\nGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories\nmust not be changed. \n\nNo amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists\nwill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of\nthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.\n\n\n|>\tThe government had a number of reasons for encouraging people\n|>to move across the green line.  They included security and politics.\n|>\n|>\tThe first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes\n|>it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements also\n|>act as fortresses in times of war.\n\nTheyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that\nwould last no more than hours against tanks,\n\n|>\tA second reason was political.  Creating \"settlements\" brought\n|>the arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns and\n|>cities gone on another several years, there would be no place left in\n|>Israel where there was an arab majority.  There would have been no\n|>land left that could be called arab.\n\nDon't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the\nnegotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf\nthey insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.\n\nIf the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have\ncut the money supply.\n\n|>\tThe fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place\n|>changes the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land can\n|>be given away.\n\nNot at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.\n\n|>\tSome of the communites created were religious.  They built\n|>their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of\n|>the 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,\n|>and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.\n\nThe existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country\nto annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.\n\n|>\tThe point is, there are many reasons people moved over the\n|>green line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whatever\n|>status is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an \"all\n|>or nothing\" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, not\n|>be the results of a war.\n\nUnless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.\nAraffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.\n\n\nThe real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the\nPalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it\nis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the\nreturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the\ndismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against\nnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. \n\nThe irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has\na non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the\nIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean\noutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying\nor using much of the land. \n\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker \n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":"From: sherwood@adobe.com (Geoffrey Sherwood)\nSubject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)\n\n\nI just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels\/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K \/ 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1\/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.

{"text":" Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.  Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology. The expert panel probed the future of P2P at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier in January. The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January. William Trowbridge and Michael Chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy. But that is going to change very soon, according to the panel.  The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. But they have slowly realised that P2P is a good way to distribute content, said Travis Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. They are just waiting to come up with \"business models\" that work for them, which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.  But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks. Remembering the furore around VCRs when they first came out, Mr Weiss said: \"Old media always tries to stop new media. \"When they can't stop it, they try to control it. Then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.\" Once the courts decided that the VCR in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. In August 2004, the San Francisco-based US Court of Appeals ruled in favour of Grokster and StreamCast, two file-sharing networks. The court said they were essentially in the same position that Sony was in the 1980s VCR battle, and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.  P2P networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. Instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. There are now many different types of P2P systems than work in different ways. P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content. The BBC has already decided to embrace the technology. It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them. The files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. The global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day. Legal music download services, like Apple iTunes, Napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. Sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the IFPI reported this week. But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.  There are several money-spinning models that could turn P2P into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. Paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various DRM solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. \"We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,\" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer.  \"Consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together,\" agreed Mr Morgenstern. But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. \"Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content,\" said Derek Broes, from Microsoft. \"They will probably play an increasing role in helping P2P spread,\" he said. Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned. \"Once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,\" he said. \"File-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" A contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped.  Lycos Europe's Make Love, Not Spam campaign began in late November but its tactics proved controversial. Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti-spam measures and had now achieved this aim. The anti-spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law.  Through the Make Love, Not Spam website, users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages. More than 100,000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered.  The company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites. But the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming-type tactics against the senders of junk mail. Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action. Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving a little too successful. According to response-time figures gathered by Netcraft, some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests. In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme, the company denied that this was its fault. \"There is nothing to suggest that Make Love, Not Spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted,\" it said. \"At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down, they were not in fact part of the Make Love, Not Spam attack cycle,\" it added. The statement issued by Lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with 5% spare capacity. \"The idea was simply to slow spammers' sites and this was achieved by the campaign,\" the company said. Many security organisations said users should not participate in the Lycos Europe campaign. The closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism.

{"text":" There used to be one subliminal moment during a year in Irish rugby that stood out more than most.  Well, at least there used to one. Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. It has been quite a year for the Irish, and not just with Eddie O'Sullivan's Triple Crown winning international outfit either. Right down through the ranks Irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. But most of the kudos will go to O'Sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first Triple Crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. For the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the RBS Six Nations. But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high. The 18-12 victory at Lansdowne Road was only their second victory over the Boks after the initial success back in 1965. That success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in Blomefontein and Cape Town in the summer. Those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against France, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. But the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf. The winning try was conceived in O'Sullivan's mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by Girvan Dempsey. For me, the try of the Championship. O'Sullivan's career is now in vertical take-off mode. It is no wonder that Sir Clive Woodward has elevated the Galway-based coach to head the Lions Test side. Not only that, but a fair majority of the present Ireland side will be wearing red next June in New Zealand.  There can be no doubt that Ireland's representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. In Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell, Ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. Gordon D'Arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the Six Nations Player of the Tournament. But it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to Ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider. The young Irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to England in the Six Nations under-21 tournament. On the provincial front, Leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the Heineken Cup looked a good wager. While Ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was Munster again flying the flag for the Irish. Looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners Wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at Lansdowne Road. How Wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat Toulouse in the final was anybody's guess. Ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural Celtic Cup in winning the Celtic League when they were pipped at the post by the Scarlets in the final game.  Ulster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach Mark McCall. The once famous Ravenhill fortress was breached four times as Ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the Celtic League. Leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under Declan Kidney is another thing. On the down side, Irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban. That happened only 10 days after he led Royal Armagh to their first Ulster Schools' Cup success since 1977. The death of former Ireland coach and Lions flanker Mike Doyle in a car crash in Northern Ireland shocked the rugby fraternity A larger than life character, Doyle had coached Ireland to the Triple Crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. Ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known Londonderry YM player Jim Huey, Coleraine's Jonathan Hutchinson, and Belfast Harlequins lock Johnny Poole. They all passed away long before the full-time whistle. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.  The decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup. \"We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate,\" said club president Juan Bautista. Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.  Things began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.  This new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as \"an island of democracy\", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The US government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.  The Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.  The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. It dries and is not visible under normal light.  However, the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. At the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his\/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. Likewise, any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. These elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the Autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former Soviet Republics, notably Ukraine and Georgia. The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.  Widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.  The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. Local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. Others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, Coalition of Non-governmental Organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as Serbia, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey. The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in Afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. The use of \"invisible\" ink is not without its own problems. In most elections, numerous rumors have spread about it.  In Serbia, for example, both Christian and Islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. Other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks, solvents and cleaning products are put forward. However, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. The ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. The passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections.\" The country's widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 February.

{"text":"From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu)\nSubject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 1: Goaltenders\n\nAs the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,\ntrying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through\nfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand\/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1\tBRIAN HAYWARD\t\tSeason:\t11th\nAcquired:\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tP (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30\tJEFF HACKETT\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tC\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31\tWADE FLAHERTY\t\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:\t\tI (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32\tARTURS IRBE\t\tSeason:\t1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

{"text":" Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia.  Robbie Keane took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory. \"We had more good chances. It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team,\" said Kerr. \"But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win.\" The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy. Kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory. \"It was a brilliant goal, fantastic skill by Damien Duff. Robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal.\" Matchwinner Keane was another full of praise for Duff's role in the goal. \"It was great play from Damien,\" said the Tottenham striker.  \"I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 Duffer is going to get it in the box. \"Playing three up was something different. Brian Kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run-out. \"The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future. It is nice to see young players coming through.\" Man-of-the-match Duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half. He opted to bring Steve Finnan's cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option. \"I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights,\" said the Chelsea star. \"I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing. \"We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers.

{"text":" A new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson.  If it gets its way, the Dutch government will conclude its presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. If the new law was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our TV screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. Sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess Middle Britain. After all, how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention? Yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the EU's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in Europe just as they are in the US. Many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. It will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.  In the US you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless Amazon lets you, because they hold the patent on \"one-click\" online purchase. It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.  We are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. The new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. They have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, radically modified by the European Parliament and then re-presented in their original form. Some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. Poland has rejected the proposal and Germany's main political parties have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. Early in December the British government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. Science Minister Lord Sainsbury went along to listen and outline the UK position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.  The draft Directive is being put through the council as what is called an \"A\" item and can only be approved or rejected. No discussion or amendment is allowed. So why should we be worried? First, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. This goes to the heart of the European project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. If coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow?  More directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent. This is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. Patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. A patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. I have never, to my shame, managed to read Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. If it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it was coincidence. The same does not hold for a patent. If I sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the LZW algorithm used in GIF files, then I am in trouble under patent law, at least in the US. Coincidence is no defence. The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. They have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.  Even this system breaks down, of course, as Microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer (and other browsers) infringed an Eolas patent. That one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. But small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. Much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the Apache web server, the GNU\/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. The damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. If the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. Eventually someone will decide to attack Linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. And it will damage Europe's computer industry. We can only hope that the Council of Ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.  Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" For gaming fans, the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left N64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.  Adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original's massive sense of fun. This however is not a sequel, nor does it relate to the GoldenEye film. You are the eponymous renegade spy, an agent who deserts to the Bond world's extensive ranks of criminal masterminds, after being deemed too brutal for MI6. Your new commander-in-chief is the portly Auric Goldfinger, last seen in 1964, but happily running around bent on world domination. With a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of Tina Turner's similarly-titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of X-ray vision.  Rogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter. The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.  Recent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise. This title lacks that aura, and when the Bond magic shines through, it feels like a lucky accident. The central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. Quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump, the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy AI, the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. Admittedly the competition has been tough, even in recent weeks, with the likes of Halo 2 and Half Life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. What the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy, dynamic scenes of violent chaos. As is the trend of late, you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. Sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos, meaning that frustration is often the outcome. And irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. A minute red dot passes for a crosshair, although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. Shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky, and you will not always know you have picked them off, since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor, and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. It is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker's allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.  By far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like Dr No, Goldfinger, hat-fiend Oddjob and crazed Russian sex beast Xenia Onatopp resurrected after all these years, and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.  There is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains, and it is a testament to the power of the Bond universe that they can cut such a dash. But the in-game niggles, combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through, will make this a disappointment for most. Diehard fans of Bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. The game is weak, not completely unplayable. Then again, 007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. Given James Bond's healthy pedigree in past games, there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip, a commendable idea that just has not worked, that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.

{"text":" Xbox video game Halo 2 has been released in the US on 9 November, with a UK release two days later. Why is the game among the most anticipated of all time?  Halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. A science fiction epic, Halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. Remembrance of Things Past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as Larry Niven's Ringworld and the film Starship Troopers, it fit the bill perfectly. Halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using Dolby Digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics.  But what marked Halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming.  Produced by Bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by Microsoft and became an Xbox exclusive. Claude Errera, editor of fansite Halo.Bungie.Org, said: \"Bungie got everything right. They were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. \"Nothing distracts you when you were playing. There was nothing in Halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be.\" He added: \"Graphically it was superior to everything else out there.  \"It also had a depth to it that made it stand out.\" Halo was unusually immersive, sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. It also capitalised on the growing popularity of LAN gaming in the PC world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.  The game instantly cultivated an online following, which continues today with a score of Halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel, Halo 2. Errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website, which attracts 600,000 page views a day from Halo fans eager for the latest news.  When the Xbox launched on November 15 2001 in the US, Halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. \"Halo is the most important launch game for any console ever,\" wrote the influential Edge magazine in its review, giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. The game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game, it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. \"The first time I played it I just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun,\" said Errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game.  The game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. \"It blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of Halo,\" said Errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of Master Chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. Video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game's amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. Speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. When early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. Errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high. \"It does not feel like a game release any more. Somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in Microsoft's history. \"We're all just hoping that Bungie has got it right again.\"  Halo 2 is out on 9 November in the US and 11 November in the UK ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Snow Patrol had \"no other course of action\" but to ask their co-founder and bassist to leave the band, lead singer Gary Lightbody has said.  Mark McClelland had been in the band for more than 10 years since its formation at Dundee University. Lightbody said \"over the last 18 months touring has taken its toll on the rest of the band's relationship with him\". He said: \"This is the hardest decision we have ever had to make and believe us when we say we didn't make it lightly.\" The group, originally from Northern Ireland, has only achieved mainstream success in the last year with the single Run and award-winning album Final Straw. In a statement on the band's website, Lightbody said: \"I started the group with Mark 10 years ago and he was a massive part of Snow Patrol and my life throughout that decade.\"  He added: \"It got to the stage that things couldn't go on as they were, so we felt there was no other course of action but this. \"I know you will all be distressed and may not understand this news but we had to do what was best for the band.\" Snow Patrol are currently working on the follow-up to their breakthrough third album. The band is set to play support to U2 on a number of summer stadium gigs. Last month, they were the big winners in Ireland's top music honours, the Meteor Awards, picking up accolades for best band and album. It followed nominations for the Brit Awards and the Mercury Music Prize. The band formed in 1994 when Lightbody and McClelland met as students at Dundee University. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow\nhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I\nsuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.\n\nIt is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from\nall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any\nconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my\nperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy\nwith current UK abortion law.\n\nSimilarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\nI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.\n\n\nmathew\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" British and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year's RBS Six Nations Championship.  World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer's tour to New Zealand. \"I don't think you can ever say never,\" said Woodward. \"But I would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.\" Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. But Woodward added: \"The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. \"My job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. \"If you are not playing international rugby then it's still a step up to Test rugby. It's definitely a disadvantage.  \"I think it's absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.\" Woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. \"It is an open book,\" he said. \"There are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.\" And following the All Blacks' impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three-test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. \"Their performance in particular against France was simply awesome,\" said the Lions coach. \"Certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but they're a very powerful unit.\" With his customary thoroughness, Woodward revealed he had taken soundings from Australia coach Eddie Jones and Jake White of South Africa following their tour matches in Britain and Ireland.  As a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and Ireland and held out hope for the struggling Scots. \"Scotland's recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. \"Eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for Australia and I will take on board their opinions.\" And Scotland forward Simon Taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. \"I took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking Lawrence Dallaglio when he wasn't fit and went on the trip. \"Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. \"I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions - and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" World outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.  Idowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. \"It's all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal,\" said Edwards. \"His ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.\"  Idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a Commonwealth silver medal to his name. Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games. But he believes the European Indoors in Madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as Britain's top triple jumper. \"He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,\" said Edwards. \"Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. I'm sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.\" The qualifying round of the men's triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday. Olympic champion Christian Olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\"\n\nWhy would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?\n\nIf we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to\nenjoy what he has given us?\n\nWhy would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I\nwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have\nbefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be\ncontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too\nare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.\n\nIn short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically\nmean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and\nfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no\nmatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.\n\nIf your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be\nit.

Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.

Or are the allegations just part of the Big\n> Cover-Up?\n\nThank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being\na Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a\nconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the \"fundy\" part as the\nterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to\nthose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and\nwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it\nmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been\nsatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling\nstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.\n\nWith respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you\nto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume\nthat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\n\nNor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\nthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\nbring upon him.  \n\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\nand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with\nDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported that\nthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.\n\nUltimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh\nis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a\nmost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.\nSo I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One\nwho has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left\non earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong\nmessage to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the\npeople it serves.\n\n--Joe Gaut\n\n> \n> (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't\n> put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

The \neconomy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is \nin outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name \nof the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful \narticle in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty \nlinen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European \nCommunity. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,\nGreece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and\nat times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  \nfeatherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community\nadmit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European\nCommunity.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that\nnotwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European\nin mentality and attitude. \n\nIndeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great \nsuccess with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, \nready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, \nsucceeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.\n\nJust 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as \nTurkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed \nby far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are \nconcerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.\n\nThe governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on \nthe infrastructure investments (rather than investing in\nworld terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue \ncompletely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question \nto conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. \nNowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote \ntown, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance \ncall to any given country.\n\nHowever, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,\nit is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany\nround the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,\nthen your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not\nbe an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of \nGreece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,\nby virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages\nof the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. \nTurkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,\nhas nevertheless managed to create a better economy which \nenabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus\nover the last two years.

{"text":" Internet giant Yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their PCs.  The firm is following in the footsteps of Microsoft, Google and Ask Jeeves, which have offered similar services. Search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. With hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos.  The desktop search technology has been licensed from a US-based firm X1 Technologies. It is designed to work alongside Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs. Searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. According to research from message analysts the Radicati Group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. Yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. Users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. \"We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,\" said Julian Smith, an analyst with research firm Jupiter. \"It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well,\" he said. Search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web. The new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups, concerned about the implications to privacy. And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. Alexander Linden, vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm Gartner,downloaded the Google product but has since removed it. \"It was just not very interesting,\" he said. He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals. \"Desktop search is just one of many features people would like but I'm suspicious of its usefulness,\" he said. More useful would be tools that can combine internet, intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching, he said. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The Grand Theft Auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years, but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition.  The 18 certificate GTA: San Andreas for the PlayStation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach. Instead, it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the Driv3r and True Crime-shaped opposition. Even in the year that will see sequels to Halo and Half-Life, it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic.  The basic gameplay remains familiar. You control a character, on this occasion a youth named CJ, who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3D environment. CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane. All come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family. To make things worse, he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town, and blackmailed by crooked cops played by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn. The setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional US state of San Andreas, comprising three major cities: Los Santos, which is a thinly-disguised Los Angeles, San Fierro, aka San Francisco and Las Venturas, a carbon copy of Las Vegas. San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.  Its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold, assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since Vice City. The streets, and vast swathes of countryside, are by turns gloriously menacing, grungy and preppy. Flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail, the game's overall look, particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets, is stupendous. The outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on. Cars handle more convincingly than ever, a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds, and there's more traffic to navigate than before. Park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway, and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up. Pedestrians are also out in force, and are a loquacious bunch. CJ can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad. They will pass comments on his appearance and credibility, aspects that the player now has control over. Clothes, tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased, and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. The character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym. He will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up, but will swell up as a result of over-eating. And at last, this is a GTA hero who can swim.  At a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, San Andreas' violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade. Developers Rockstar have not shied away from brutality, and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.  When hijacking a car, for example, CJ will gratuitously shove the driver's head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle. Indeed, the tone is darker than the jokey Vice City. The grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game. This title, incidentally, is set in 1992, but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists. The wit is still present, just more restrained than in previous outings. A further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options, where GTA games' trademark humour is anchored. The quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart. The game's rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed. It is a testament to San Andreas' magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws, but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don't detract. The on-screen map, for instance, is needlessly fiddly, an unwelcome change from past editions. There is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments. And the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre, setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission. But the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. You simply will not be bothered by these minor failings. San Andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.

{"text":" The world's first digital cinema network will be established in the UK over the next 18 months.  The UK Film Council has awarded a contract worth \u00a311.5m to Arts Alliance Digital Cinema (AADC), who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. AADC will oversee the selection of cinemas across the UK which will use the digital equipment. High definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly British and specialist films. Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. The new network will double the world's total of digital screens. Cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.  Each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. Fiona Deans, associate director of AADC, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.  The film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. \"People will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. \"The picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.\"  The key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of British films, documentaries and foreign language films.  \"Access to specialised film is currently restricted across the UK,\" said Pete Buckingham, head of Distribution and Exhibition at the UK Film Council. \"Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK,\" Digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said Ms Deans. \"It can cost up to \u00a31,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. \"In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. \"Distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer.\" The UK digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. A separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in May. The sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. \"Some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don't need to be shown twice a day,\" explained Ms Deans. \"A cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. \"With digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" A study of the United States at war in the past 50 years has picked up one of the main awards at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival in Utah, in the US.  Why We Fight scooped the grand jury prize for documentaries at the world's leading independent film festival. British director Sean McAllister's The Liberace of Baghdad - about a pianist in war-torn Iraq - won a special prize in the world documentary category. Both Why We Fight and The Liberace of Baghdad were made for the BBC. Why We Fight is due to be screened on BBC Four in March.  The Sundance festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981. This year's festival - which ended on Sunday after a 11-day run - has been dominated by the themes of war and politics. In the new world cinema drama category, the Angolan film The Hero triumphed to win the grand jury prize. The film - an Angolan\/French\/Portuguese production - tells the story of a veteran of the country's civil war who returns home to face a new battle of survival. Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focused on countries and people under siege.  Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya and Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells the story of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. But it was Dutch documentary Shape of the Moon - a study of an extended family in Indonesia - which took the top prize. Meanwhile, French-Israeli production Wall, which looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories, picked up a world cinema special jury prize for documentaries. In the main drama category, Forty Shades of Blue was named winner of the grand jury prize. The film tells the tale of a forbidden tug-of-love between a father, his Russian immigrant girlfriend and his son.  During its 24-year history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. Last year's festival provided a platform for hits such as Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me. The festival is held in the mountain resort of Park City, east of Salt Lake City, which sees its population rise from 7,500 to 45,000 during the festival. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org>\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\n\n\nFrom: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\n\n\nZionism and the Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.\n\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\nbe it.\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

(Don't think I'm going to say, \"spend it to educate \npeople\", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  \nthings like drug treatment programs.\n\nI saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually \nprescribe and addict his \"recommended\" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,\nor cut the amount down to levels where it is \"acceptable\".  Sounds good so far \nfrom what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out \nthe dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)\n\nHowever, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be \nbought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a \nrecommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.\nThe 60 Minute Report said it worked with \"cocaine\" cigarettes, pot and heroin.\n\nRyan\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

I mean, it was the\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\nwere starting to come up strong.\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\nteam\/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\ndon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\"There's no time to hate, barely time to wait\" (Jerry Garcia\/Robert Hunter)\n\n       \n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

The first version of the service is part of Google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond. \"We think TV is a big part of people's lives,\" said Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice president of product management. \"Ultimately, we would like to have all TV programming indexed.\"  Google Video has been indexing US-based programmes from PBS, the NBA, Fox News, and C-SPAN since December. But there were few clues from Google about when more global broadcasters would be included. \"Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today,\" a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.  The results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel, date and time. It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function.

{"text":"From: jamesc@netcom.com (James Chuang)\nSubject: Re: Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip?\n\nIt seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible\n486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:\nAnd also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.\n\nThe 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX\nsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.\nthe 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any\nsoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the\ncoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the\nactual coprocessor.\n\nThe internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit\nrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance\nboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a\n386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and\nQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,\nis about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is\naround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,\nand DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS\/2\ncompatibility, but I didn't test it.\n\nThe 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually\na small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains\nthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX\nPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board\ndoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when \naccess to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available\nfrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20\nonly.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.\nIf Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need\nto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...\n\nI also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K\nexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still\nsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.\n\nIMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or\ncan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,\nbut if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure\nabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't\nbeat it in any significant way.\n\nThe last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,\nasking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:\n\nTreasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.\n1-800-677-9781\nThe 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00\n\nBut....\n\nI liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.\nIf you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you\nmore info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,\nSo I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions\nregarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.\n\njamesc\n909-396-0408\n\n\n-- \n=========================================\nIf someone asks if you are a God, you say...

I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n> The same\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.

{"text":" The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.  As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. Along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers' Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003. Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November. Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.  Authenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.  \"If you're issued a seafarer's ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed,\" Authenti-corp's CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBC's Go Digital programme. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. \"By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,\" said Ms Musselman. \"It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Could Half-Life 2 possibly live up to the hype? After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.  Fortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. No-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. All the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. The player sees things through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 Half-Life. Having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic City 17. It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. Sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.  You are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. It is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. Finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. That does not really matter. HL2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. Underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. There are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. Exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.  Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.  Considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. But if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your PC's components, this is it. On our test machine - an Alienware system with an Athlon 3500+ processor and ATI's Radeon X800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. It is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. The haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. Luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. So impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. There are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. Freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.  Virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. You will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. At times Half-Life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. Running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. Human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. The stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. In gameplay terms, HL2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. And without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of Doom III, it's all incredibly unsettling. The vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point I even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.  The game does have a couple of problems. Firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.  A lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. If you like things open-ended and free-ranging, Far Cry will be a lot more pleasing. But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. Installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. The box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. The time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental Valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, Half-Life 2 is up to the challenge. It is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.  Half-Life 2 is out now for the PC ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.

Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.

The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein\nare outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the\nabsurd things he says.

{"text":" An Austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television.  The people of Engerwitzdorf are filming, editing and producing their own regional news channel. The channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on PCs. The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.  \"It's growing unbelievably fast,\" said Rudolf Fischer, head of Telekom Austria's fixed line division. The trial of Buntes Fernsehen (Multi-Coloured TV) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based TV station run by the 8,000 residents of Engerwitzdorf. The hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by Telekom Austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers. Any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a Buntes Fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. In the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. \"They have adopted it very quickly,\" said Mr Fischer. \"They like the possibility to create their own content and see what's going on in the area.\" \"It's kind of the democratisation of local TV,\" he said, \"because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region.\" The Buntes Fernsehen project has been such a success that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria's online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC. Aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.

{"text":" Actor Keanu Reeves, best known for his role in the Matrix movies, has been awarded a star on the prestigious Hollywood Walk of Fame.  The 40-year-old attended the unveiling of the star with his mother, Patricia, and thanked her for inspiring him to become an actor. \"When I was 15 years old I asked my mom if it was OK to be an actor,\" Reeves said. \"She said: 'Whatever you want'.\" His star is the 2,277th to be embedded in the pavement on Hollywood Boulevard.  The actor, who was born in the Lebanese capital Beirut, also spoke of how he dropped out of school to pursue an acting career. \"Hollywood was calling,\" he said, \"So I got in my car, a 1969 British racing green Volvo with holes in the floor and bricks holding up the seats. I was a young man full of hopes and dreams.\" Reeves first found fame in the teen comedy Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and went on to combine such blockbusters as Speed, The Devil's Advocate and the Matrix series, with smaller films including My Own Private Idaho. More recently he was seen in Something's Gotta Give alongside Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. His next film, the supernatural thriller Constantine, is released in the US later this month and opens in the UK in March. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Film director Quentin Tarantino is to direct an episode of US television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.  The Oscar-winning Pulp Fiction director has also written an original story for the season finale episode. CSI's co-producer, Carol Mendelsohn, said the episode would have \"more bugs and blood\" than usual. It is not Tarantino's first venture into TV. In 1995 he directed an episode of the medical drama ER and has also appeared in Alias.  Ms Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show's stars persuaded him. \"He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. We had a story meeting with the writers. \"He had a great idea, and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy.\" Filming is due to start in early April and the Tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.

When we\ndo something to make a particle \"appear,\" we are actually causing\nall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is\none line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some\nof the scientific community.\n\nDr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused\nby the mental effort of observing the particle.

Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind\ncould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of\npossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of\ncommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. \nI have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self\ndelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection\nof one of many possible futures.\n\nI realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep \nan open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile \nexplaination of the world in which we find ourselves.

To make things compatable,\n>I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade.  However, when all the dust settled, and I go into windows, it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was, in the Windows directory.  My question is:  How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive, and the permanent one doesn't?\n\nyou might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best\nexplanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...\n\nThe permenant swap file is read\/written to by windows by talking\ndirectly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must\nuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).\nWindows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that\npoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your\ndisk to index to information in that file.\n\ncompressed disks are actually \"logical\" disks.  These disks have different\ncharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information\non the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must\ngo through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating\nsystem level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \"inbetween\" program, windows\ncannot use direct methods to read from the \"logical\" disk.\n\na permenant swap file is only there to \"reserve\" an area of the disk that\nwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically\nnot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't\nknow if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you\nboot windows.)\n\na temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows\nvia DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded\nthe file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in\norder to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)\n\nmore on permenent swap files...\n\ni'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk\nhas seen the message \"you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested\nsize...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this\nswap file anyway\" or something like that.\n\nwell, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.\nwhat they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and\ndivides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block\nof free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.\n\nThey also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows\nuses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he \nsaid!\n\nI call bull@#$#.

The individuals of the minority living in Western\nTrace are also Turkish.\"\n\nEmphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in\nWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement\nsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey\nin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.\n\nRecalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.\nSadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,\nFaikoglu said.  \"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights.\"\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n|3|\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling.\"\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\nare over.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

{"text":"From: seth@cbnewsh.cb.att.com (peter.r.clark..jr)\nSubject: FLYERS notes 4\/5\n\n\n\nThe FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum\nSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0\nshutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1\/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks has gone on sale in the US, after years of legal wrangles.  With the Lights Out was intended to be released in 2001, to mark the 10th anniversary of the album Nevermind. It was blocked by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who did not want unreleased song You Know You're Right on the box set. The dispute between Love and surviving band members Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl was settled in 2002. Work began on the box set in 1998, but legal battles put the project on hold. The legal fight centred on a studio recording of the unreleased track You Know You're Right, regarded by fans as one of the unreleased gems of Nirvana. The set, released on Tuesday, features three CDs and a DVD of rare performance and rehearsal footage. The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991. \"The band wasn't always pretty, or always in tune. This is not Nirvana unplugged. It's Nirvana unedited,\" said Cobain biographer Charles Cross. The band's development ended tragically when songwriter Kurt Cobain committed suicide in April 1994.

While\nI'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples\nof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.\n\n1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.\nSo have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.\nUnless the league notified teams this year about not allowing\ncomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.\n\n2)  It's not as if Gant was \"in Hirschbeck's face\".  Gant said\nsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away\nfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but\nwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick\non a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box,\nif for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on\nthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry\nat the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\n\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\nGant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\ndugout.  Cox was tossed \"protecting his player\".  I was pleasantly\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\n\nIt's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I will\nkeep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the \nfuture, in order to improve my sample size.\n\nIMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was\na bad game for the umpire.\n\nEric Roush\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Like some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to today's gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.  With its hand-animated sprites and 2D side-scrolling, this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. And yes, that includes Halo 2. Simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2D side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.  Players must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.  The shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. And at a mere \u00a320, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says. Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation, Metal Slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates' eye.

{"text":" Aston Villa's Thomas Hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager David O'Leary before committing himself to a new contract with the club.  O'Leary has been in talks over a new deal and he said: \"I had a message from Thomas' agent asking me what the news was on myself. \"He wants to find out before he goes into discussions over Thomas. \"The reason Thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me.\" Hitzlsperger's current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered a new deal by the Midlands club. The German international is understood to be keen to remain at Villa, despite interest in his native country from Hamburg. But he wants assurances that O'Leary will also be committing himself long-term because negotiations over a new three-and-a-half-year contract appear to have stalled.  O'Leary wants his backroom staff - assistant manager Roy Aitken and fitness coach Steve McGregor - to also be given satisfactory deals, which will tie them to Villa until the summer of 2008.

{"text":" Thousands of products and tens of thousands of visitors make Cebit the place to be for technology lovers.  \"Welcome to CeBit 2005\" was the message from the pilot as we landed, the message on flyers at the airport, and the message on just about every billboard in town. CeBit fever has taken over Hanover. Hotels have been booked out for months; local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors, visitors, and journalists. CeBit itself is huge, the exhibition site could almost be classified as a town in its own right.  There are restaurants, shops, and a bus service between the halls - of which there are 27. There are more than 6,000 companies here, showing their latest products. The list of them that I was given when I came in is the size and weight of a phone book. One of the mains themes this year is the digital home, and one of the key buzzwords is convergence.  The \"entertainment PC\" is being billed as the replacement for DVD players, stereos, telephones and computers - offering a one-box solution, wirelessly connected throughout a house. To show them off, one display has been modelled as a prototype \"digital lifestyle home\" by German magazine Computer Reseller News. \"We wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace, to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes,\" said Claudia Neulling from the magazine. The house has webcams for security in each room, which can be called up on the high definition TV, connected to the PC in the living room.  That PC provides home entertainment, movies or music. It can also be linked to the car parked outside, which is kitted out with a processor of its own, along with a DVD player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back. \"Convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer,\" said Mark Brailey, director of corporate marketing for Intel. \"The real challenge is to show people it's easier than they think, and fun.\"  He firmly believes that entertainment PCs are the future, but says they have to get past people's fears of frequent crashes and incompatibilities. That is something Microsoft is trying to do too - its stand has computers running Windows XP Media Centre edition 2005 for people to try out. Mobile phones do not escape the convergence theme. Samsung is showing off its SGH-i300, a handset with a three gigabyte hard drive, that can be used to watch compressed video or as an MP3 player. And if you would rather watch live TV than a downloaded movie NEC is showing a phone, on sale in China, which can show analogue TV on its colour screen.  \"I think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station - if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example\" said Koji Umemoto, manager of mobile terminals marketing for NEC. He admitted that the signal quality is not very good if you are on the move, and they do not have plans to launch it in Europe at the moment. Nokia was happy to demonstrate its 6230i, an upgrade to the very popular 6230.  It now has a 1.3 megapixel camera, and a music player that can handle multiple formats, rather than just MP3s. It is also compatible with Nokia's new Visual Radio technology. The handset can receive FM broadcasts, and the user can interact with compatible broadcasts using a GPRS connection, to take part in competitions or get extra information such as the name of the song playing. Most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market.  Portable media player firm Creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. \"The benefits over conventional Bluetooth are the lack of interference, and longer battery life,\" said Riccardo de Rinaldini, Creative's European marketing manager. The firm has a prototype headset linked up to a Zen Micro player. The transmitter on the player creates a private, magnetic \"bubble\" around the user, which is picked up by the headset. The range is only about one metre so it is only suitable for personal use. A single AAA battery is said to last up to 30 hours. Creative expects it to hit the market in its final form later this year. Even clothing is likely to be part of the convergence trend. Adidas has a trainer which, according to Susanne Risse from the company, can \"sense, understand, and adapt to your running style\". It has a battery, processor, and motor embedded in the sole. Buttons on the side allow you to set the amount of cushioning you would like by adjusting the tension on a cable running through the heel. The processor then monitors the surface you are running on, and adjusts the tension accordingly. It is being billed as \"the world's first intelligent shoe\". ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may make his comeback after an Achilles tendon injury in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday.  He has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February. But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

I'm curious, though,\nwere the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or\nwere they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just\nregistering the shotgun?\n\n>\tAnd -unbelievable- the use of guns in crime fell.....\n>\tThere are now a new law against wearing long knives in public,\n>\tand why should it be allowed ??\n\n\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only\na couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most\nfeared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to\nspend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.\nMaybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become\ncivilized with?\n\n>\tYes, I know a little American history, but is it a civil\/human\n>\tright to have an assault gun in your home and\/or an handgun\n>\tin your car??\n\nYes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not\na homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \"Americans\" first\nand foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,\nwhereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in\nyour veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale\nand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a\nbasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.\nIn America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother\ntells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke\n\"low Dane,\" whereas others spoke \"high Dane.\"  It was shortly after\nWorld War II, as I remember, that \"low Dane\" was abolished so there was\none common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,\nbecause we have even more obvious means of identifying an \"outsider.\"\n\n>\t\t\tThe bad english is not my fault, it's probably\n>\t\t\tthe keyboard-software or the quality of the\n>\t\t\tsubtext on tv......\n\nTake heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.\nAny helpful hints for our educational system?

{"text":" Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek after Portsmouth claimed a draw at Anfield.  Dudek fumbled a cross before Lomana LuaLua headed home an injury-time equaliser, levelling after Steven Gerrard put Liverpool ahead. Benitez said: \"It was difficult for Jerzy. It was an unlucky moment. \"He was expecting a cross from Matthew Taylor and it ended up like a shot, so I don't blame him for what happened.\" Benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by Liverpool, who followed up their derby defeat against Everton with a disappointing draw. He said: \"We had many opportunities but didn't score and, in the end, a 1-0 lead was not enough. \"If you don't have any chances you have to think of other things, but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players. It was a pity. \"We lost two points, but we have one more point in the table.

{"text":" Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson has been named as England's new rugby union captain for the three November Tests.  The 25-year-old Newcastle star takes over from Lawrence Dallaglio, who retired from internationals in August. England's acting head coach Andy Robinson said: \"He is a natural leader, holds the respect of the squad and is a formidable talent on the pitch. \"And he consistently demonstrates the energy and commitment I feel is essential to be captain of England.\" Robinson added: \"There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge. \"Captaincy offers a challenging environment for any player, especially following in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio and before him the World Cup captain, Martin Johnson.  \"But I am confident Jonny has what it takes to do an outstanding job as we look ahead towards the next Rugby World Cup in France and I look forward to working with him.\" Wilkinson, who has scored 817 points in 52 internationals, kicked the winning drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time in England's 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph against Australia. But he then missed the entire 2004 Six Nations campaign while recuperating from shoulder surgery, before making his comeback for Newcastle in the Zurich Premiership in August. \"It's the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream,\" he said. \"I'm honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years.  \"Getting my first England cap against Ireland six years ago was something I'll never forget because to play for your country is very special. Taking on the captaincy is another important step in my career and I do so with immense pride.\" Wilkinson made his international debut in the 1998 Six Nations Championship against Ireland when he came off the bench to replace Paul Grayson.  He has been a regular in the England starting line-up ever since, played in all three Lions Tests in 2001 and all but one of England's games in the 2003 World Cup. He becomes the 117th captain of England since Fred Stokes held the position in 1871. England's first autumn Test is against Canada on 13 November, followed by the visit of Tri-Nations champions South Africa a week later and then a World Cup re-match with Australia.

{"text":" The FA is to take action after trouble marred Wednesday's Carling Cup tie between Chelsea and West Ham.  Police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the West Ham support after the match which the Blues won 1-0. Mateja Kezman, the scorer of Chelsea's goal, needed treatment on a head injury during the match after being hit by a missile, believed to be a coin. A spokeswoman for Chelsea said the club would await the referee's report before deciding on its course of action. Kezman was forced off the field to receive treatment on a cut above his eye but was able to continue.  Chelsea assistant boss Steve Clarke said: \"I would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd. He did not require stitches.\" West Ham boss Alan Pardew said: \"It's a shame because I thought there was good English banter in the crowd. \"There's big rivalry between the two clubs and it is a shame if that's happened. From where I was standing I didn't see any trouble.\" Former Hammers star Joe Cole also had a plastic bottle thrown at him, while Frank Lampard was pelted with coins as he was preparing to take a penalty. Lampard's spot-kick was saved to the delight of the Hammers' fans, who have still not forgiven him for leaving Upton Park. The FA will seek reports from the clubs and the police, and will review video evidence and the referee's report. Police in riot gear battled with West Ham fans in the Matthew Harding stand and at least one supporter required treatment. Fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game. Scotland Yard said there had been 11 arrests for alleged public order, drugs and offensive weapon offences.  The FA is already looking into the trouble at Tuesday's heated Carling Cup tie between Millwall and Liverpool. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\n\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like \na good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.

Bring your families too, not only you will help a great\ncause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts\nwho are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic center\nor Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option \nfor students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please, spread the word around...\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nKhalid Chishti \n\nIf you live in Massachusetts and want more info:\n\nCall Ginan (from New England Bosnian Relief Committee): 617-623-1973 \nOR \nNew England Bosnian Relief Committee phone no:  (617) 464-0111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: These are my opinions only and has nothing to do with my employer...\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Ireland and Munster lock Paul O'Connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.  O'Connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job, but says he is totally focused on Sunday's Six Nations crunch clash with England. \"I honestly don't think about these reports,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The Lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk, nothing more. I just ignore it and get on with my job.\" He added: \"The only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think. \"I can just imagine them saying 'I'm going to show this guy what's what about second row play'. That's the one thing that makes me cringe.\" O'Connell, who made a try-scoring international debut against Wales two years ago, is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby's shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the Lions.  \"I have spoken to Sir Clive Woodward a few times, but not for very long, certainly nothing about summer holidays,\" he joked. He also said he remains wary of wounded England's abilities coming into Sunday's game after two straight defeats, dismissing predictions of a certain Irish victory. \"It's very dangerous to think that. This England team has so much experience and skill. You do not become a bad team overnight. \"They have two world class game-breakers in Josh Lewsey and Jason Robinson, while Charlie Hodgson is just ready to click into place.\" He insisted Ireland will not make the mistake of being over-confident. \"That's not going to happen in our squad. No Ireland team lining up to play England will ever fall into that trap,\" he said. \"Every time we play England we know what a big task it is. Look at what they did to us two years ago. I remember that game all too well, and it was not a good feeling. \"I came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6, and ended up getting hammered 42-6, so I know what can happen when England come to Dublin. \"They could so easily have been coming to Dublin with two wins and staring a Grand Slam in the face as well.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The body that oversees how the net works, grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years, but it is just the start.  \"In a sense, we have hardly started in reaching the whole population,\" the new chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Brian Carpenter, says. The IETF ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net's architecture. With broadband take-up growing, services like voice and TV will open up interesting challenges for the net. \"I think VoIP (Voice-over Internet Protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the Net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms,\" says Dr Carpenter. \"Second, it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. With VoIP, you need very little infrastructure.\"  A distinguished IBM engineer, Dr Carpenter spent 20 years at Cern, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. As the new chair of the IETF, his next big challenge is overseeing IPv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. At Cern, Dr Carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well-placed to take on such a task. The net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the IETF. The top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with.  The net is built on a protocol called TCP\/IP, which means transmission control protocol, and internet protocol. When computers communicate with the net, a unique IP address is used to send and receive information. The IETF is a large international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the net's architecture and the way this information is sent and received. They make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps. \"We've seen some interesting effects over last few years,\" explains Dr Carpenter. \"The net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s. Then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000. \"We are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth.\"  That renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like China, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. The number of broadband subscribers via DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) doubled in a year to 13 million, according to figures released at the end of 2004. \"The challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate,\" explained Dr Carpenter. \"Given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions. If you want to reach the whole population, you have to make sure it can scale up.\" IPv6, the standard that will replace the existing IPv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world. \"The actual number of addresses with IPv4 is limited to four billion IP addresses. \"That clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of IP - IPv6. \"It has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits,\" said Dr Carpenter. Standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. The difference this next generation standard, IPv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible. \"Our first goal is that it [IPv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference. \"It is like when the London telephone numbers got longer. A lot of the process will be invisible. \"People are usually given an IP address without knowing it.\" Technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said Dr Carpenter.  The one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. To Dr Carpenter, the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. People have to be educated about \"sensible behaviour\" he says, such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something.  \"I don't think it is going to get worse. People will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street. \"We have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. It is a never-ending battle in a sense.\" But, he adds: \"Even if security has improved, you still worry a bit. Unfortunately, it is just part of life. We have a duty to do what we can.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre)\nSubject: Theists And Objectivity\n\nCan a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?

{"text":" Voting is under way for the annual Bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year.  Nominations were announced on Sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog. Blogs had a huge year, with a top US dictionary naming \"blog\" word of 2004. Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to US research think-tank Pew Internet and American Life, but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months.  Nikolai Nolan, who has run the Bloggies for the past five years, told the BBC News website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. \"The awards always get a lot of traffic; this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit, so I had to guess how much I'd need,\" he said. There were many new finalists this year, he added, and a few that had won Bloggies before. Several entries reflected specific news events. \"There are four nominations for the South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog, which is a pretty timely one for 2005,\" said Mr Nolan.  The big Bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. Fighting it out for the coveted award are Gawker, This Fish Needs a Bicycle, Wonkette, Boing Boing, and Gothamist. In a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs, The South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog is also nominated in the best overall category. GreenFairyDotcom, Londonist, Hicksdesign, PlasticBag and London Underground Tube Blog are the nominees in the best British or Irish weblog.  Included in the other categories is best \"meme\". This is for the top \"replicating idea that spread about weblogs\". Nominations include Flickr, a web photo album which lets people upload, tag, share and publish their images to blogs. Podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. It is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of RSS (really simple syndication) and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows, and distribute them automatically onto portable devices.  Many are done by those who already have text-based blogs, so they are almost like audio blogs. Three new categories have been added to the list this year, including best food, best entertainment, and best writing of a weblog. One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. The winners of the fifth annual Bloggies are chosen by the public. Public voting closes on 3 February and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 March. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.  Moya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.  Aged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.  A European Union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions. It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii. It could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism.  The technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.  The Lifeplus project is part of the EU's Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage. Engineers and researchers working in the Europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. It would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. At Pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life. Augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as Troy and Lord of the Rings and in computer gaming.  \"This technology can now be used for much more than just computer games,\" said Professor Nadia Magnenat-Thalman of the Swiss research group MiraLab.  \"We are, for the first time, able to run this combination of software processes to create walking, talking people with believable clothing, skin and hair in real-time,\" she said. Unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. The software capable of doing this has been developed by a UK company, 2d3.

{"text":" Microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns.  The company said the move was a \"preventative step\" after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. It affects Xboxes made before 23 October 2003 for all regions but mainland Europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 January 2004. Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. The firm said fewer than one in 10,000 consoles had experienced component failures. The recall affects almost three quarters of all Xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.  In a statement, it added: \"In almost all instances, any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console.\" But in seven cases, customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. In 23 cases, customers reported smoke damage, or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. \"This is a preventative step we're choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents,\" said Robbie Bach, senior vice president, Microsoft home and entertainment division. \"We regret the inconvenience, but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do.\" Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the UK. Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. It advised users to turn off their Xboxes when not in use. A follow-up to Xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: dswartz@osf.org (Dan Swartzendruber)\nSubject: Re: Ax the ATF\n\n\nA few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:\n\n1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\n   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\n   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm\n   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the \"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's\n   paranoid delusions.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>\n\nDan S.\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  The firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  Currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.  The move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  Shelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.  She said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.  Viotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.  He conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.  The last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.

{"text":" Technologies, from e-mail, to net chatrooms, instant messaging and mobiles, have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love.  The lure once was that you could hide behind the technology, but now video phones are in on the act to add vision. Hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world's first video mobile dating event. The top 100 meet their match on 30 November at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). The event, organised by the 3G network, 3, could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events, like speed dating, continues. \"It's the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it,\" said Graeme Oxby, 3's marketing director. The response has been so promising that 3 says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon. Hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles, and special booths were set up in a major London department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances. The 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ICA in separate rooms and \"meet\" by phone.  Dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies. Whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen. Flic Everett, journalist and dating expert for Company magazine and the Daily Express, thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers. There are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the UK and three times more single people in Britain than there were 30 years ago, With more people buying video mobiles, 3G dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people.  \"One of the problems with video phones is people don't really know what to video. It is a weird technology. We have not quite worked out what it is for. This gives it a focus and a useful one,\" she told BBC News. \"I would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did,\" she said. \"Lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face. Lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable.\" \"When you are writing, it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest.\" But the barrier that comes with SMS chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are. Scare stories have put people off as a result, according to Ms Everett. Many physical clues, body language, odd twitches, are obviously missing with SMS and online dating services. Still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues. \"It could really take off because you do get the whole package. With a static e-mail picture, you don't know who the person is behind it is.\" So checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier, an extra layer of protection; a case of WLTS before WLTM. \"If you are trapped in real-life blind date context, you can't get away and you feel embarrassed. \"With a video meeting, you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don't like them you don't have to suffer the embarrassment.\"  There is a more serious side to this new use of technology though. With money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat, the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3G, thinks Paolo Pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts IDC. \"Wireless is a medium that is being exploited with a number of features and services. One is chatting and the dating element is key there,\" he said. \"The foundation has been set by SMS and companies are using media like MMS and video to grow the market further.\" But carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such 3G dating services, they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis, he cautioned. In July, Vodafone introduced a content control system to protect children from such adult content. The move was as a result of a code of practice agreed by the UK's six largest mobile phone operators in January. The system means Vodafone users need to prove they are over 18 before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes. The impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net, and the growth of 3G technologies. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Manchester rock band Doves have entered the UK album chart at number one with their new release, Some Cities.  The trio replace flamboyant US act Scissor Sisters at the top. The album follows single Black and White Town, which reached number six. R&B star Nelly has the new number one single with Over and Over, which sees him team up with Tim McGraw. Girls Aloud, Akon and Kaiser Chiefs all have new singles in the top ten, as do Futureheads and Usher.  The latest Elvis Presley re-release, (Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame, entered the chart at number three, one place ahead of Girls Aloud's Wake Me Up. Hip-hop performer Akon's Locked Up is at number five, while hotly-tipped Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs have their second chart hit at number six with Oh My God.  Futureheads' cover of Kate Bush's Hounds of Love entered the chart at number eight, while Usher's Caught Up was a new entry at number nine. In the album chart, operatic quartet Il Divo's eponymous debut rose 23 places to number six, while crooner Tony Christie's Definitive Collection is a new entry at number 10, making it the highest-charting album of the singer's career.

But we're also not going to promote pandering to\ncorporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*\ndealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the\nregistration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to\nbe solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour\nreinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one\nway or another.\n\nSo, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the\nprocedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:\n\n1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want\nto install it.  I've been using c:\\WINSTALL myself.\n\n2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\WINORIG.\n\n3.  Install from c:\\winstall.\n\n4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  \n    i.e., comp *.* \\winorig\\*.* >\\report.txt\n\n5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming\nthey didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one\nfile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate\nsaid offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex\neditor, and do the same for the modified one.\n\n6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't\nreally do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I\nthink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing\nhis copy than with \"real pirates\" who will probably just disassemble\nthe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about\nany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original\nfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able\nto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a\ncompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).\n\nAs I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and\ndon't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one\ndirectory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff\nI've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if\nthey'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you\ncould also mung something important... duh.

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team.

But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries.\"[1]\n\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\n\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\n\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests.\" (A.

{"text":" Italy skipper Marco Bortolami believes Saturday's Six Nations contest against Scotland will be a scrappy encounter.  With both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at Murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider.

Italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the Six Nations in 2000, but two of those have come against Scotland. This year, Italy opened up with a stubborn display against Ireland but ended up losing 28-17.  However, they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive Welsh side in Rome last time out. Now the Italians travel to Edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the Six Nations. \"Scotland played extremely well against France in Paris but not so well when Ireland came to Edinburgh,\" said Bortolami. \"We are still very disappointed with our last game against Wales in Rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs. \"As a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Generally, these\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\n\t the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\n\t [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\n\t families and received as servants when they are left alone through\n\t the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\n\t all such children in your province and send them to the places of\n\t deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\n\t the people.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [1]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the\n\t time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their\n\t lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [2]\n\n\t\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.\n\n\t November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the\n\t orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their\n\t places of exile.\n\n\t \t\t\t\tAbdullahad Nuri. [3]\n\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been\n\t opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is\n\t done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\n\t of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\n\t any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\n\t purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\n\t detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\n\t into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\n\t special orphanages for them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat.\" [4]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\n\t Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\n\t to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with\n\t the caravans.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [5]\n\n\t\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows\n\t of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is\n\t not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by\n\t Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble\n\t in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned\n\t out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\n\t deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent\n\t away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [6]\n\nIn 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs\nabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \"rationalizing\" this\nultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:\n\n\t\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for\n\t its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks\n\t it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\n\t shall die for it.\" [7]\n\n\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\nTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\n\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\n\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \nPersian\/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\na forgery. \n\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \nheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a\nfocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.\n\nThis monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological\ndenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only\ncrime was to be born Armenian.\n\n\t\t\t- - - references - - -\n\n[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60\n\n[2] ibid, page 60\n\n[3] ibid, page 60\n\n[4] ibid, page 61\n\n[5] ibid, page 61\n\n[6] ibid, page 62\n\n[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and\n    London), 1926, page 387\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

The motion-sensitive phone - officially titled the V603SH - was developed by Sharp and launched by Vodafone's Japanese division. Devised mainly for mobile gaming, users can also access other phone functions using a pre-set pattern of arm movements. The phone will allow golf fans to improve their swing via a golfing game.  Those who prefer shoot-'em-ups will be able to use the phone like a gun to shoot the zombies in the mobile version of Sega's House of the Dead. The phone comes with a tiny motion-control sensor, a computer chip that responds to movement.  Other features include a display screen that allows users to watch TV and can rotate 180 degrees. It also doubles up as an electronic musical instrument. Users have to select a sound from a menu that includes clapping, tambourine and maracas and shake their phone to create a beat. It is being recommended for the karaoke market. The phone will initially be available in Japan only and is due to go on sale in mid-February. The new gadget could make for interesting people-watching among Japanese commuters, who are able to access their mobiles on the subway. Fishing afficiandos in South Korea are already using a phone that allows them to simulate the movement of a rod. The PH-S6500 phone, dubbed a sports-leisure gadget, was developed by Korean phone giant Pantech and can also be used by runners to measure calorie consumption and distance run.

{"text":" Well, it's goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens.  Obviously, there's no getting away from the differing fortunes of Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. But I want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics.      One of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly's success in the 800m.  Winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. Kelly had been full of \"should I, shouldn't I?\" thoughts about going for the double in Athens. I thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event? It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story.      The victory for the British men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games. I think the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      Hicham El Guerrouj's Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kelly's on a global scale.  He was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. As soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and I had finished commentating, I jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. He is one of the few African runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the Roger Bannister stories. Hicham is someone I enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my French and his English are not very good.      What happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. There were a set of circumstances around Athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which I think has been greatly misunderstood. Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. That was her heart and not her head reacting. Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  Things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. I think she came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained. And if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. The positive thing to take from Paula's Olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      Purely as a race, Paula's victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. It was so nip-and-tuck between her and Kenya's Susan Chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real \"bouncebackability\". And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      Kelly and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team. We should be concerned that we're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  The only individual men's finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m. I am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? And that's where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy. Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB. The thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond.      I tell you what I really enjoyed this year, Benita Johnson winning the world cross country championships back in March. In the absence of Paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an African preserve. So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      To be honest, I'm getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially Balco. I just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  Having said that, I'm always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over Kenteris for a while. The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Arsene Wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper Manuel Almunia for the crunch week which could define Arsenal's season.  Almunia will start Tuesday's Champions League group tie against Rosenborg and is likely to face Chelsea on Sunday. Wenger said: \"You don't think I would take out one goalkeeper for just one game, do you? I don't do that. \"I have to give him a run for a few games. It's just that I don't want to make this story bigger than it is.\" Wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old Spaniard, who was signed last summer from Celta Vigo as back-up to Jens Lehmann.  \"If you look at my career, you will see that I have left many big players out for a long time. I've done it with Dennis Bergkamp, Kanu, everybody. \"It's because it's a goalkeeper, that's all. It's a usual situation for me. You put your best team out, no matter who it is. \"For me, it was not a big mistake at Old Trafford and I wasn't alarmed by what happened against Birmingham either. \"It's nothing against Lehmann. I think he's a great keeper, as is Almunia. You can only play one of them. \"These people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. Just because Lehmann doesn't play for two or three weeks, or longer or shorter, it doesn't mean I've lost faith in him.\"  But former Arsenal keeper David Seaman believes Lehmann has been harshly treated. Seaman told the Daily Mail: \"Jens is a fantastic keeper. He deserves another chance. \"He has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice.\" With Arsenal hit by injuries and suspension, inexperienced midfield pair of Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas will line up against Rosenborg but Wenger is confident they will prove more than capable. \"It puts a lot of pressure on them but it's a good learning process,\" said Wenger. \"I'm not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate.\"  The Gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender Sol Campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. And the 30-year-old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve Champions League success with Arsenal. Campbell said: \"It means a lot to me to go through, it's everything. We want to carry on in this competition. \"That's where the best teams in Europe are. To be in there, playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy, is the first thing in my mind.\"  Meanwhile, Thierry Henry believes he will be blamed if Arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League. Henry will captain the side in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira as the Gunners seek the required victory over Rosenborg. And the striker said: \"If we don't win and we go out of the competition, like it or not, it's going to be my fault. That's the way it is. \"If the team don't win I know I will be criticised, no matter how I play.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Veteran US television host Dick Clark is in hospital in Los Angeles after suffering a mild stroke.  The 75-year-old presented long-running show American Bandstand from 1956-87 and has since hosted game shows and produced award ceremonies. Clark is scheduled to welcome in the New Year on the ABC network, a job he has done for 33 years. The presenter said that he is \"hopeful\" of getting better in time to lead the festivities in New York's Times Square. Clark's publicist Paul Shefrin said the television host was \"recovering\" and there was no cause for alarm. Clark, who produces the Golden Globe and American Music Awards, disclosed last year that he was suffering from diabetes.  His popular music show American Bandstand was first broadcast in 1952, and attracted an audience of 20 million people after it was picked up by ABC in 1957. The long-running weekly series, which featured guests including Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Aretha Frankin, came to an end in 1989. Clark was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contribution to the music industry. He has also been responsible for television series such as TV Bloopers, Celebrity Boxing and drama American Dreams. Clark is also expected to act as executive producer for the upcoming Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which is taking place on 16 January. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs\/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n>Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement\n>is totally meaningless.

I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky.

Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of \nposting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.\n\nThis file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota\nPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with \nPHONE. \n\nFor additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at\n<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>\n\nBest wishes,\nAshok\n\n-- begin SLIP.TXT --\nBased on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here\nare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the\nTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring your Modem:\n\na) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)\n   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use\n   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program\n   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit\n   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.\n   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.\n\n   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a\n         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.\n\nb) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done\n   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of\n   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the\n   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and\n   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with\n   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver\n   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a\n   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.\n   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and\n   batch file examples.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring the SLIP drivers:\n\nThere are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available\nCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver\nSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver\nSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)\nETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)\nUMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)\n\nOf these four, I vastly prefer C\/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or\nETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:\n\na) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART\nb) While using EtherSLIP\/SLIP8250\/UMSLIP, myself and several others\n   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a\n   long FTP transfer.\nc) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode\nd) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C\/SLIPPER seem to work with\n   every TCP\/IP application that I have tested it with.\n\nInstructions for C\/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)\na) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:\n   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1\n   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600\nb) If you use DOS TCP\/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the\n   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual\n   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS\n   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all\n   use this virtual driver at 0x60.\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nc) If you use QVT\/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT\/net is configured in\n   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:\na) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern\n   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware\n   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.\nb) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a\n   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.\n   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600\nc) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP\/IP applications in Windows 3.x\n   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nd) If you use WinQVT\/net, load PKTINT.COM\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:\nIf you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the\ninstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You\nwill have to DELETE the line \"device=*vcd\" from the [386Enh] section\nof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm\napplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped\ncharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not\nrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:\n   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring Windows 3.1:\n\na) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]\n   section.\n   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.\n       COM1Base=03F8\n       COM1Irq=4\n       COM2Base=02F8\n       COM2Irq=3\n       COM3Base=03E8\n       COM3Irq=5\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,\n       but double-clicking on the \"Ports\" icon.\n   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer\n       COM1Buffer=10000\n   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish\n       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that\n       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to\n       another application.  If you use WinQVT\/net and then want to switch\n       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value\n       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.\n       COM1AutoAssign=0\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.\n       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under \"Device Contention\", set\n       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to\n       \"Never Warn\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional notes:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each\nSLIP session?\n\nI am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user\na permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI\neach time that I establish a SLIP connection.\n\nIf you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,\nplease try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the\nconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP\nwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a\nsituation such as this, you must do the following:\n\nEdit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:\n\n[net]\nname=\nip=\nnetmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)\narptime=20\npacket_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)\n\nSave the changes, and then *write-protect* this file\n\"attrib +r qvtnet.ini\"\n\nStart your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address\nthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT\/net 3.1x, the\ngeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and\nIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],\nand you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not\nbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.\n\nA more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address\nassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\nVictor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.\nBootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a\nfile called \"myip\".  Another file \"noip\" is essentially a complete\nQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step \"myip\"\nand \"noip\" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of\nVictor's batch file is provided below:\n=====================================================\nslipper com2\npktint.com\nbootpq -i \"ip=\\\"%%s\\\"\"  >> myip\nbootpq -i \"My IP# is: %s\"\ncopy \/q net + myip + noip e:\\com\\qvtnet\\qvtnet.ini\ndel \/q myip\n@echo off\necho .\necho Ready to run WinQVTnet\n=====================================================\nFor questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor\nMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\n\nQPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT\/net.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?\n\nPKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes\nimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COM\n\nPKTMUX will work with C\/SLIPPER.EXE, when C\/SLIPPER is used in ethernet\nsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:\n\nThe latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you\nuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with\napplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).\n\n[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]\n\nlh c\/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)\nlh pktmux 5 65 \/5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)\nlh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT\/net)\nlh pktint.com           (QVT\/net pktint.com)\npktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)\n\nAdditional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within\nWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is\ndirected to the file \"popmail.bat\".  This is what popmail.bat reads\nlike:\n\npktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60\ncd \\popmail\npopmail\ncd \\\npktdrv 60 \/u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60\nexit                    causes the DOS window to close\n\nI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP\/IP applications\nlike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine\neven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS\nsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example\nwithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for\nGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each\ninstance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C\/SLIPPER?\n\nI have a V.32bis\/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with\na reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these\nconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and\nbeing used as follows:\na) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session\nb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session\nc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS\n\nI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb\/sec while transferring\ncompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with\nSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP\/IP session\nis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session\nis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb\/sec on the same\nfiles.\n\nWhile there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,\nfor me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the\nperformance hit.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nC\/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode\n\nIn ethernet simulation mode, C\/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the\napplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications\nthat required ethernet simulation balked at C\/SLIPPER 1.2, but even\nthese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3\n\nWhen SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,\nI get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads\n\"IP:incorrect packet type\" or \"IP:bad version number\".  This does not\nseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on\nloss of performance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat can you do if your DOS TCP\/IP application does not work with\nC\/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?\n\nIn the rare event that you find a package that does not work with\nC\/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --\nPeter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him\nknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is\nkosher, but it worked when I had problems with C\/SLIPPER ver 1.2\n\n(C\/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)\n\nI load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate\nETHERSL.COM\n\nThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a\npacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box\nat a time.\n\nSo for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a\nmedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library\nof Medicine).\n\nethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP\ncd \\gm6\nsearch\ncd \\\ntermin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP\nexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows\n\nIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have\nany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing\nthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no\nproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no\nproblems with C\/SLIPPER ver 1.3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPHONE Script Files:\n\nThe documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on\nwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than\nthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script\nthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.\n\nBackground:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,\nand login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP\nsession with the following command \"slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu\",\nfollowed by my password -- again.\n\nHere then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -\n#\n# CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3\/26\/93\n# Last revised 3\/28\/93\nProcedure    Host.CWRU.Login\nTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'\nMessage         \"CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1\"\nMessage         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'\nQuiet ON\nExpect 'Verification'\nMessage         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'\nMessage         'Sending your user name and password'\nQuiet OFF\nExpect   'Username:'\nSend '%u<'\nExpect   'Password:'\nPrivate\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'\nTimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'\nExpect 'CWRU-TS2>'\nSend 'SLIP<'\nTimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'\nExpect 'IP hostname or address:'\nSend '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'\nTimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'\nReject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'\nExpect 'Password:'\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'\nTimeOut 10\nExpect 'Header Compression will match your system'\nMessage 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'\nWait 1.0\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login\n#\n#\nProcedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut\n# Nothing special needs to be done to logout\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut\n#\n#   End of Script file\n#\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?\n\nThe quick answer -- there is no \"clean\" way.  Below is a batch file\nhack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this\nexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a\nbatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you\nplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,\nport address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,\nCSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory\nor in your path ...\n\nAll that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection\nusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the\nconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...\n\n-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n@echo off\nrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn. \"SLIP.BAT\"\nrem   awaiting a version of C\/SLIPPER that can directly interact\nrem   with PHONE\nrem   CWRUSLIP.BAT file is used with PHONE.EXE to start a SLIP\nrem   connection on CWRU-TS2\nrem   last modified 3\/28\/93 -- Ashok Aiyar\n\n@echo off\ncls\ngoto start\n\n:start\nif %1. == ?.         goto help\nif %1. == help.      goto help\nif %1. == setup.     goto setup\nif %1. == dial.      goto forceD\nif %1. == hangup.    goto forceH\nif %1. == quit.      goto forceH\nif %1. == HELP.      goto help\nif %1. == SETUP.     goto setup\nif %1. == DIAL.      goto forceD\nif %1. == QUIT.      goto forceH\ngoto bogus\ngoto unload\n\n:forceH\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone force hangup\ngoto unload\n\n:slipper\ntermin 0x60\nREM  the following line must be changed to reflect the COM port,\nREM  IRQ, baud rate, and software interrupt\nlh c:\\packet\\cslipper com1 vec=60 baud=57600 ether\ngoto end\n\n:forceD\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone force dial\ngoto slipper\n\n:setup\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone setup\ngoto help\n\n:unload\ntermin 0x60\ngoto end\n\n:bogus\necho %1 is not a valid command.\necho Try \"cwruslip help\" for a list of valid commands\necho.\n\n:help\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\necho           Case Western Reserve University SLIP Setup\necho                  using Univ. of Minnesota PHONE\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\necho cwruslip setup     modem settings, phone number, username etc.\necho.\necho cwruslip dial      DIAL and establish the SLIP connection\necho cwruslip quit      HANGUP the phone and unload the driver\necho cwruslip help      this screen\necho.\n\n:end\n-- end CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhere to Get What.....\n\nPeter Tattam's programs are archived at ftp.utas.edu.au (C\/SLIPPER,\nand the Trumpet set of programs).\n\nWinQVT\/net is generally archived at most Windows FTP sites,\nincluding ftp.cica.indiana.edu\n\nNCSA Telnet is archived at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu\n\nNuPOP is archived at ftp.acns.nwu.edu\n\nPOPmail\/PC, SLIPDISK, PHONE, and PC Gopher are archived at\nboombox.micro.umn.edu\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- end SLIP.TXT --\n\n\n\n--\nAshok Aiyar                        Mail: ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu\nDepartment of Biochemistry                       Tel: (216) 368-3300\nCWRU School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio         Fax: (216) 368-4544\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" A low-budget horror film produced by Evil Dead director Sam Raimi has topped the North American box office.  Boogeyman, which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past, took $19.5m (\u00a314.9m) in three days. Last week's chart-topper, the Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek, fell to number four. Other new entries included The Wedding Date, a comedy starring Will and Grace's Debra Messing, at number two.  The road-trip comedy Are We There Yet? and multiple Oscar nominee Million Dollar Baby completed the top five. Other Oscar contenders, including The Aviator and Sideways, continued to perform strongly at the box office. The Aviator has taken $75m (\u00a340m) so far, while Sideways has taken $46.8m (\u00a324.8m) in a more limited release.  Boogeyman, which cost just $7m (\u00a33.5m) to make, performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release - normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office. \"I certainly believe it's a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say,\" said Rory Bruer, head of distribution for Sony Pictures, which released the film in the US. Overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was American football's Super Bowl weekend - a time when cinema admissions generally fall. This year, the top 12 films grossed around $91m (\u00a348.3m), compared to 2004's Super Bowl weekend when the total box office was $73.4m (\u00a338.9m). ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.

Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?  \n\nDave\n__________\nDave Bonar\nmebonar@lsuvax.sncc.lsu.edu\n__________\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Lansdowne Road, Dublin  Sunday, 27 February  1500 GMT  BBC1, Radio 4 LW and this website  Ireland are going for their first Grand Slam since 1948 after two opening wins, and England represent their sternest test of the Championship so far. England were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against Wales and France and another loss would be unthinkable. The pressure is on coach Andy Robinson and his side have to deliver.  Despite England's dramatic dip in form since the World Cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors. \"Had they kicked their points they would have beaten France and that would have created a different landscape for Sunday,\" he said. \"This is England we are talking about. They have a depth of talent and a very good record against Ireland. \"They will target a victory in Dublin as the turning point in their Six Nations.\" The differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the Dublin encounter.  Ireland, despite having Gordon D'Arcy still out injured, have been boosted by the return of star skipper Brian O'Driscoll who missed the Scotland game with a hamstring injury. \"The knowledge that the England game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation,\" he said. \"The will to play in this game was enormous. It doesn't get much bigger than England at home.\" As well as entering the tournament without players like Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Richard Hill, England have now lost two tighthead props in Julian White and Phil Vickery while blind-side flanker Lewis Moody is a major concern. Robinson, who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre Mathew Tait, has kept faith with kicking fly-half Charlie Hodgson despite his horror show at Twickenham. If England slump in Dublin, it will be their worst run of results in the Championship since 1987.  But Robinson was bullish during the week about the game, saying that his side \"are going there to get in their faces\", and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to England's chances. And despite the recent results, skipper Jason Robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp. \"There is no lack of confidence in the team,\" said the Sale full-back. \"We have had a good week's training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. \"I still believe in this team. I know if we get our game right we will win the games.\"  G Murphy; G Dempsey, B O'Driscoll, S Horgan, D Hickie; R O'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes; M O'Kelly, P O'Connell; S Easterby, J O'Connor, A Foley.

Michael\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\n \n> ... The Great  Commandment is, more than anything else, a call\n> to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility*\n> in your every action. ...\n\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\nloving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \n\n> ... \"Conservatives\" may twist this \"act as if you were God\" to \n> mean \"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them\n> as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"  They are so\n> insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\n> lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such \n> idiocy IS how God acts. ...\n\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \n\n> But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\n> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\n> may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n> -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \n\n> And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n> *different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).

The one, single, thing in the gospels\n> which Jesus specifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love\n> one another.\"\n\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \n\n-*----\n> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\ngospel.\n\n> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\n> tell you something about Christianity? ...\n\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\nshouldn't do. \n\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\nmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\nChristian interpretation.  \n\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\nlukewarm we should spit out. \n\nRussell\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":"From: abig@netcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp)\nSubject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest)\n\n\tIntro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \n\tContest Announcement)\n\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\n\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \nsuch as CAD\/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \nMultiple-Player\/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \nPlug and Play on every PC.\n\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\nplatform use of the same device.\n\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\n=====================================\n\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \nfee or royalty.\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \ndata rate is 100 Kbits\/sec.\n\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \nsynchronization.  \n\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\n\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \nreceiver.  \n\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \nadditional semantics, including checksum.\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \nsystem is running, without rebooting.\n\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\n\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\n\n\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\n------------------------------------------------\nPostal Address:\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\nFax: (408) 991-3773\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save\nourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their\nproblems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked \nin the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left\nin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to.

{"text":" Sci-fi shooter Doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the Golden Joystick awards.  It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas. The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August. Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize. Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.  But they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda. The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (\u00a38.3m). The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance. Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record \u00a31,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.  The .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann. The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture.  The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.  The .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. It is backed by a New York-based trade group called The Travel Partnership. Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. A similar proposal has been made many times in the past. But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. But domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" If you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.  The relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. To begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3G) mobile phones become inescapable. The 3 network launched in 2003, Vodafone launched its consumer service in November, Orange followed in early December and T-Mobile and O2 are due to launch in 2005. The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.  Already the extra capacity in 3G networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. \"Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and I'll write their obituary\" said Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel.  Instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3G phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. But 3G will not have everything its own way. It will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax. This wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. Kent is likely to be the site of the UK's first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3G and will be a clear winner. Bob Larribeau, principal analyst at Telecom View, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. The technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.  Moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.  For a start, BT looks set to roll out its Bluephone project during the next 12 months. The service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). Voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK's net using population, can use Voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for Voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused Voip call services starting up. Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. Convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer)\nSubject: Darrrrrrrrryl\n\n\n\nThe media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\n\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\nthe catch.\n\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\n\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\nof the fan.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n\n\n-- \nMark Singer    \nmss@netcom.com\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said.  Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.  Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.  \"There isn't anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine's executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to \u00a39m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.  \"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered,\" the council's spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to \u00a34m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.  Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words \"Stay tuned\". No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.  Lycos Europe's \"Make love not spam\" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. But the plan has proved controversial.  Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.  The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, \"Stay tuned\". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. \"Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,\" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. \"Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the January transfer window.  Wenger has brought in Manuel Almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form Jens Lehmann - but the Spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. There have been suggestions that Wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the New Year. But he told the Evening Standard: \"I don't feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in January.\" The Gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old Almunia has made to his career at Highbury. And he would not be drawn on whether Lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with Chelsea on Sunday.  Almunia was at fault for Rosenborg's goal in Arsenal's 5-1 Champions League win on Tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week's win over Birmingham. But Wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media. \"The debate has gone on too long. Everyone has an opinion and I do not have to add to it,\" Wenger added. Arsenal have been linked with Middlesbrough keeper Mark Schwarzer, Fulham's Edwin van der Sar and Parma's Sebastien Frey. And Wenger has no immediate plans to recall former England Under-21 international Stuart Taylor from his loan spell at Leicester. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

How's that for an answer?  :-)\nSeriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are\ntalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, I\nbelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,\ndirect or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it would\noffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but\nbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannot\nescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were\n\"whites only\" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains\nfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains\ncertainly were not applied to \"whites only.\"  In essence, we\ncannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to pay\nproperty tax.  On the other hand, private employers are not a\nmonopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not by\nthe government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over to\nthat government.\n\n#> Why?

In Santa Cruz\n(where a number of loony anti-discrimination laws exist),\na guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had\nevery imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe,\nand his tatoos were very distracting.\n\n#> Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA.

But say I were to buy\na unit in another town, and have it managed by a third party.\nLet's say that I have a real aversion to Christians because\nof the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker, and\nbecause of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected.\nI don't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window\nof a house that I own.

{"text":" Microsoft's Internet Explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited Firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released.  Few people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. But the release of the first full version of Firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. Fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the New York Times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. The release of Firefox 1.0 on 9 November might even cause a few heads to turn at Microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's Internet Explorer browser.  Firefox has been created by the Mozilla Foundation which was started by former browser maker Netscape back in 1998. Much of the development work done since then has gone into Firefox which made its first appearance under this name in February. Earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called Phoenix and Firebird. Since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Rivals to IE got a boost in late June when two US computer security organisations warned people to avoid the Microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.  Internet monitoring firm WebSideStory has charted the growing population of people using the Firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of IE. Before July this year, according to WebSideStory, Internet Explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. That figure had remained static for years. In July the IE using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of October stood at 92.9%. The Mozilla Foundation claims that Firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the Windows- using, net-browsing population. Firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than Internet Explorer and has some innovations lacking in Microsoft's program. For instance, Firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. It blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.  One of the most powerful features of Firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it. The Mozilla Foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. This has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar Google toolbar to a Homeland Security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. Firefox, which used to be called Firebird and before that Phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. A campaign co-ordinated by the Spread Firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the New York Times. The campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. Ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised. The ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late November\/early December. The surplus cash will be used to help keep the Mozilla Foundation running. Microsoft is facing a growing challenge to IE's hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as Opera, Safari, Amaya and even Netscape. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Actor Leonardo DiCaprio's \"exceptional career\" has been honoured at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.  The star was presented with the award by Martin Scorsese, who directed him in Oscar-nominated movie The Aviator. \"It's a lifetime achievement award, which is completely and utterly surreal, given I'm only 30 years old,\" DiCaprio said. \"But what has it been? Almost 17 years now. I've done quite a few films.\" A retrospective of his movies was shown.  \"What's really exciting, for me, is that this is what I really love doing,\" he added. \"It's what I want to do for the rest of my life.\" DiCaprio began his movie career in horror film Critters 3, before moving onto roles in The Basketball Diaries, Romeo and Juliet, Titanic and Gangs of New York. The achievement award was created to commemorate the California festival's 20th anniversary and coincided with DiCaprio's portrayal of millionaire Howard Hughes in The Aviator.  Veteran actress Jane Russell, who starred in Hughes' 1943 film The Outlaw, said was impressed by DiCaprio's quest for authenticity when he previously discussed the role with her. \"I was very happy that (DiCaprio) came and cared to come up and find out what (Hughes) was really like,\" she said. The Aviator has taken pole position in this year's Oscars race with 11 nominations, including nominations for best film, best actor for DiCaprio and best director for Scorsese.

{"text":" UK video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles, the industry warns.  Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said that more UK firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles. Three leading UK video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months. Microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that Xbox 2 will be released in the US before the end of 2005.  The new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games. Mr Hasson said: \"In the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers.\" He said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close. \"Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities,\" he said.  Mr Hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines. That figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the BBC News website - Codemasters, Climax and Rebellion.  \"As consoles get more powerful, the content gets more detailed and that means more cost,\" said Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, which develops games in house and also publishes titles. Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion, said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because \"the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger\". He added: \"We have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. \"Each one has involved the death of some people. All companies said they were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control.  Simon Gardner, president of Climax's Action studio, said: \"We are investing in superior tools and editors. We are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams. \"It's vital we avoid huge teams.\" He said Climax was already directing about 20% of its resources to preparation for next generation titles. Mr Dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming, development and artistic talent. \"If companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams, at some point the talent is going to run out.\" Mr Hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more \"business-like\". \"There are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days. \"Some of them are still making games for peer group approval - that has to stop.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests.  Instead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.  For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"  One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.  Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.  Once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims.  The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage. However, DEC has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.  The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads \"Urgent Tsunami Earthquake Appeal\" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. The web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. Patricia Sanders, spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down. She said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. It is thought that the fake site is being run from Romania. Ms Sanders said DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.  DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said.  Ms Sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not DEC's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. All attempts by the BBC News website to contact the people behind the site have failed. None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. This is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. One e-mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands. The con was very similar to the familiar Nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. In a monthly report anti-virus firm Sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during January. Another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program. Anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers.  It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors. Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500. They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses.  They will be formally sentenced next year. A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted. Prosecutors said Jaynes was \"a snake oil salesman in a new format\", using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported. A \"Fed-Ex refund processor\" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home. Another item on sale was an \"internet history eraser\". His sister helped him process credit card payments. Jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales, prosecutors said. \"He's been successful ripping people off all these years,\" AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying. Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said. Prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for Jaynes, and a jail term for his sister. But Jaynes' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term \"outrageous\" and said his client believed he was innocent. He pointed out that all three of the accused lived in North Carolina and were unaware of the Virginia state law. Spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent.

{"text":" Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas.  With Apple's iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff. \"The iPod mini is likely to be this year's Tracey Island,\" said Mr Irish. Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one.  For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. Star of the show will be Sony's Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.  But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. \"He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him,\" said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. \"Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis,\" said Mr Irish.  For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have. \"What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them,\" said Mr Irish. This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve. \"Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves,\" said Mr Irish. \"Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Director Quentin Tarantino is in talks to write and direct a new instalment in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  The film-maker will reportedly meet executives from New Line Cinema this week to discuss the 12th film in the long-running 'stalk and slash' series. The original film, released in 1980, has spawned ten sequels based around mask-wearing murderer Jason Voorhees. The most recent, Freddy Vs Jason, was released in summer 2003. That film saw Jason battle Freddy Krueger, star of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. According to the industry newspaper, New Line had been trying to make another sequel involving Ash, the hero of the Evil Dead movies, but was unable to agree terms with director Sam Raimi. Tarantino is said to be intrigued by the prospect of building a new film around one of the horror genre's most recognised figures. First, however, he is scheduled to direct the season finale of US television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Filming is due to start in early April. Tarantino's episode, for which he also wrote the original story, will be broadcast in the US on 19 May. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \n: favorite.\n\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\nChicago produced this table:\n\n\t\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\n\t\t\t    Resulting in Death\n\t\t\t    \n\tWeapon\t\t\t\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------\n\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\t\t 2.4\n\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\t\t12.2\n\n\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\n\t\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1\/1\/80 to 12\/31\/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 \/ 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 \/\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 \/ 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n\tJohn H.

{"text":" DVDs will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm Macrovision.  The pirated DVD market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. Macrovision says its new RipGuard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current DVD ripping (copying) programs used to pirate DVDs. \"RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,\" said the firm. Macrovision said the new technology will work in \"nearly all\" current DVD players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard. Some BBC News website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that DVDs will not work on PCs running the operating system Linux. The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales.  The film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download.  \"Ultimately, we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,\" said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against \"rent, rip and return\" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Martina Navratilova has defended her decision to prolong her tennis career at the age of 48.  Navratilova, who made a comeback after retiring in 1994, will play doubles and mixed doubles events in 2005. \"Women's tennis is really strong,\" she said, dismissing suggestions that the fact she could still win reflected badly on the women's game. \"All I can say is I'm that damn good. I'm sorry but I really have to blow my own horn here. I'm still that good.\" Navratilova has won three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles since she came out of retirement. And she was so encouraged by her form that she decided to resume playing singles, winning two of her seven matches. She was knocked out in the first round of the French Open but reached the second round at Wimbledon. Navratilova will partner Nathalie Dechy in the doubles event at the Uncle Toby's Hardcourts tournament on Australia's Gold Coast, which begins on Sunday. She will then link up with Daniela Hantuchova for the Australian Open doubles, and play in the mixed doubles with Leander Paes. \"I might be playing some singles events this season, depending on the surface,\" she added.

{"text":"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org>\nSubject: Re: Israel: An Apartheid state.\n\n\nI think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which\none can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute\nracial discrimination. These criteria are to be found for example in the\n1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial\n    Discrimination (ratified by most countries)\n2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights\n3.   The Human Rights Charter\n4.   The European Convention of Human Rights\n\nIf one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these\nlegally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is\nobvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.\n\n\nThe people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion\nby the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live\nunder Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.\n\nThey are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole\nreason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any\nprovisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.\nIsrael's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing\nthe return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of\nthe State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under\ninternational law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It\nwould facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east\nand constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence -\nin the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the\nIsraeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with\ngenociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews, who sincerely wish that\npeace prevail in Israel\/Palestine, will finally realize this fact.\n\nElias Davidsson\n\n\nPS: Please read carefully the first post in this topic, where the facts of\nZionist racial discrimination are described.\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" The latest handheld gaming gadget, Sony's PlayStation Portable, goes on sale in the US on Thursday.  The entertainment device, which also stores images, music and video, is intended to compete with Nintendo's DS, released earlier this month in the UK. Gamers have been queuing outside shops across the US to get their hands on the gadget, which costs $250 (about \u00a3132). The first million sold will come with the Spider-Man 2 film on UMD, Sony's own disc format for the device. The PSP can be linked up with others for multiplayer gaming, via a wireless connection. Sony has touted the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan since its launch there last year.  But it faces stiff competition from the Nintendo DS, which sold more than the GameCube in its first few days on release in Europe. It too allows for multiplayer gaming over the air. Nintendo dominates the handheld market, with more than a 90% share of the market in the US alone. The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget also went on sale in the UK last week. It hopes to take a share of the handheld gaming market too.  \"The story of the PSP is it's not a gaming device as much as it is a portable entertainment device,\" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. He told the Reuters news agency that he expected Sony to sell about 10 million PSPs in enough time to rival Apple's iPod. There is no date for the PSP's release in Europe yet. Sony has promised to have a million units ready for its US launch, but there are fears demand may not be met. It also said it expected to ship three million PSPs worldwide by the end of its fiscal year ending 31 March.  The machine's European launch was put back \"a few months\" last week in order to make sure enough of the devices were ready for its US launch, as well as satisfying the Japanese market. The PSP has almost as much processing power in it as the PlayStation 2 console. Hundreds of gamers gathered at US shops, some waiting for more than 36 hours, to be the first to get their hands on the gadget.

{"text":" Jolanda Ceplak has urged Britain's Kelly Holmes to continue competing at the major championships.  Double Olympic gold medallist Holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year's Worlds and is undecided about next month's European Indoors. But World Indoor 800m record holder Ceplak said: \"There is never an easy race when she is in the field. There is only excitement at what might happen. \"It is good for the sport. She always fetches the best out of everyone.\" Ceplak has been a great rival of Holmes' during the Briton's career and the pair fell out when Holmes questioned the manner of the Slovenian's runaway 800m victory at the 2002 European Championships. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes' failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003.  Ceplak added: \"I like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. \"That is the sort of competition that I like. She is special to me. She was like my idol from the beginning of my career.\" Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturday's win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Friday's Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany. Britain's Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday. Gardener's decision means Scotland's 400m man Ian Mackie will carry British hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend's Norwich Union European trials in Sheffield.

{"text":" Third-generation mobile (3G) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services.  That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association. At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks. The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks.  \"High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,\" according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys. A number of companies are developing the technology. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access. The two companies aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers.  \"While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,\" said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. \"The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G],\" he added. Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO).  US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year. We are \"expanding our network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,\" said Oliver Valente, Sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4Mbps. MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany, has opted for technology based on HSDPA. Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4Mbps. US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA, using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson.  Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: \"By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.\" Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. This enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. The speeds offered by 3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences. But today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - much faster than 3G. This means users are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the networks are souped up. If they aren't, those lucrative \"power users\", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. A commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

His\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\n\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\nover the years, as well as his SB\/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\nML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)\n\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \nspeed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have \na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best\noverall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\nto 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\nscarce.\n\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\nI'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\nto an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach\nhustle.\n\nAll that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term\ncontract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible\nin 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and\nlimitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's\ngot some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances\ndown the road with Nieves et al.\n\nEric\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

The American had too much power for her 15-year-old opponent, breaking twice in the first set and once in the second. The German-born Vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find a way back after falling behind 3-2 in the opening set. Davenport, who closed out with an ace, plays Karolina Sprem in the next round. \"I was fully expecting a tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it,\" said Davenport. \"I think she hits some great shots. She made some errors but probably some inexperience played a role in that. But she's so young and obviously has a big game and has many, many years to improve on that.\" Sprem, the Croatian 13th seed, saw off Russia's Elena Likhovtseva 6-3 6-2. Former world number one  powered her way into the fourth round with a straight sets win over Anna Smashnova. The 27th seed from Israel stuck with Williams until 3-3 in the first set before it became one-way traffic.  The American made 26 unforced errors but was still good enough to romp through the contest in exactly an hour. She reeled off nine straight games to finish a 6-3 6-0 winner.  remains on course to become the first Australian to win her home title since Chris O'Neil in 1978. The 10th seed equalled her best performance at a Grand Slam event when she beat unseeded Russian Nadia Petrova 6-3 6-2 to reach the fourth round. After a tough first set, Molik grew in confidence and won in just 56 minutes. She will now meet Venus Williams. \"Bring it on,\" said the 23-year-old. \"I played pretty well and it was nice to get through in straight sets.\" \"We were destined to meet, I guess,\" Williams said referring to her match with Molik. \"It will be a huge match for her in Australia. I can tell she's probably very motivated by that so I need to get out there and play well.\"  beat Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova in a rollercoaster match. Dementieva came through 7-5 5-7 6-4, becoming the seventh Russian woman to reach the last 16 in Melbourne. The match lasted almost three hours and featured 13 service breaks, including three in the final set when Dementieva held her nerve to seal the win. She now faces  after the Swiss 12th seed beat American Abigail Spears 7-6 6-3. French Open champion  received a free ride into the last 16 after Lisa Raymond was forced to withdraw. Raymond, the 25th seeded American, was ruled out after sustaining a left abdominal muscle tear in the doubles. Myskina, the third seed, now plays France's  who beat Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-3 6-3. \"I'm extremely disappointed because I couldn't have asked to play better in my first two matches,\" Raymond said.

{"text":" If you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.  ArtGarden, developed by BT's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures. Clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works.  The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. It 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. So, for instance a Whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and Whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. \"It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery,\" said Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme. For Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. \"I went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for Christmas but I didn't have a clue what I wanted,\" he said. The text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which he found helpful. He ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead.  He thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. Similarly, with art, browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. \"You don't arrive at Tate Britain and tell people what you want to see. One of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn't have asked for,\" he said. The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that, said Ms Rellie. She hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \nStates Bill Clinton.\n\t     \n\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \nfound not guilty.\n\t     \n\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \nadministration and what you're trying to do.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\n\t     \n\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\n\t     \n\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \n\t     \n\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \nviolence and drugs.\n\t     \n\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \nproblems as we do.  \n\t     \n\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \nbattle?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n\t     \n\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \nto a vote.\n\t     \n\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\n\t     \n\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \nhis office lately?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \nof the budget I presented.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \nputting the American people back to work.  \n\t     \n\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \nthe need for jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have some questions from people who supported \nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \nit was going to be like this.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \nwide range of things.  \n\t     \n\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \nreal, real progress.  \n\t     \n\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \nthings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Thank you very much.  \n\t     \n\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, \nKDKA News.\n\n                               END10:31 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":"From: svec5@menudo.uh.edu (T.C. Zhao)\nSubject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations\n\n\n   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\n\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\n\nNAME\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\n\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\n\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and\/or quantization of\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\n\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\n\nFEATURES\n\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \n  the processed image will be displayed.\n\n  Current features include\n\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\n\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and\/or y-directions with\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\n\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\alpha$\\small$\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\n\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\n\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\n\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\n    circle).\n\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\n\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\n\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\n    arbitrary order.\n\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\n\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\n\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\n\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\n\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\n\n  o Performs image type conversions.\n\n  o Converts image formats.\n\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\n\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\n    back and display it.\n\n  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.\n\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\n    resulting power spectra.\n\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\n\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\n      o  CompuServ GIF\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\n      o  TIFF\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\n\nHardware requirements:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\n\nWhere to get it:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   \/pub\/bit\/bitxxx.tar.Z\n   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73\n\n   Read src\/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking\n\nAcknowledgement:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.\n   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.\n   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate\n  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of\n  your editing needs.

{"text":" The Welsh Rugby Union wants to restructure the Northern Hemisphere season into four separate blocks.  The season would start with the Celtic League in October, followed by the Heineken Cup in February and March, and the Six Nations moved to April and May. After a nine week break, the WRU then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. WRU chairman David Pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. He added: \"We feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. \"Equally, we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully, the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure.\" Moving the Six Nations from its traditional February beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and \"stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing\", Pickering argued. The plan will be put before the International Rugby Board next month, where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. Pickering added: \"It's very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters, which is extremely important. \"We've got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

It was filed on behalf of about 12,000\nanti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the\nplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.\n     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available\nfor comment on Wednesday.\n     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that\nGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed\nconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.\n     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and\nGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco\nand Los Angeles.\n     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,\nwhich prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.\nIt seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other\nunspecified damages.\n     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the\nplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his\nwife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.\n     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the\nUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence\nMinister.\n     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on\nhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of\nPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.\n     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both\nkept information on thousands of California political activists.\n     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid\nBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and\nBullock received confidential information from the authorities.\n     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case.

None\nof us is violent or criminal in any way,\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education\nconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.\n   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister\nMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\nbecause he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit\nbecause it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York\nheadquarters.\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\npublic television station KQED.\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwise\npublic\" from state or federal records.\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons and\nentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.\n   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San\nFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.\n   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL\ninformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.\nGerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed\ninformation on to Bullock.\n   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.\nBullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit\nbecause he had not yet studied it.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPwe 04\/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents\n\n   SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday\ncharging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy\nby spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments.\n   The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADL\nand its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information\non outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and\nSouth Africa's apartheid policy.\n   The ADL refused to comment on the suit.\n   The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San\nFrancicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees\nin the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.\n   According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential\nfiles in law enforcement and government computers.

{"text":" Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday.  The French star was part of the Chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2000. \"Things will be totally different this time,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Now everyone knows about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.  Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for \u00a34.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.  \"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea.  He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. \"I'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,\" he said. \"I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. \"And it's amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.  He said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.  \"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.  \"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"  He said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office.

{"text":" Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club.  \"It could help. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season,\" he said. \"If we manage to get through it shows how well the club's progressing. \"They have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on.\" A win for Robertson's side against Ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if Basle fail to beat Feyenoord. \"It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive,\" added Robertson. \"But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit.\" With the game being played at Murrayfield instead of Tynecastle because of Uefa regulations, Robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue.  \"The pitch is not in the greatest condition. The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare,\" he said. \"It's not ideal but it's the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. That's the most important thing.\" But he added: \"If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. \"There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. \"We need their encouragement, we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. \"Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

(The X-axis being the +\/- deviation in clutch hitting\nvs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly\nthere would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\n\n  As a counterexample to \n>what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\n>\n>               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\n>               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\n> \n>Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\n>Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\n>\n>If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\n>situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \n>1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\n>hit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \n>completely cooking the data,\n\nYou won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\non his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,\nbut you may indeed be right.  \n\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\n\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\n\n\n>BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with\n>'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\n>something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\n>(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \n>0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\n\nI completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\nthe same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\nbasis? \n\n>Actually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future\n>clutch performance.

All types of software may be submitted for\nentry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.\n\nWSM benefits Windows shareware\/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize\ntheir software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase\ntheir installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software\nwill benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their\nfingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other\nrelevant information.\n\nWindows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all\n   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart\n   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details\n   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,\n   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any\n   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the\n   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the\n   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it\n   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480\n   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.\n   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will\n   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files\n   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting \n   conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,\n   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows\n   NotePad to create the .TXT file. \n \n2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which\n   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases\n   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may\n   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit\n   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which\n   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's\n   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or\n   WinGIF. \n\n3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs\n   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be\n   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.\n\n4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  \n\n5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional\n   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).\n\n6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:\n   \n   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU\n\n   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America\n   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP\n   file, then e-mail to:\n\n   DiegoAA\n\n7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete\n   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,\n   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.\n\nAll entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent\nedition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and\nwe reserve the right to make changes to the entries.\n\nWSM is not limited to shareware\/freeware software.  A special area will be\ndevoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial\nsoftware authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of\nthe limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required\n(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There\nis no charge for the publishing of either shareware\/freeware or commercial\nproduct entries.  \n\nAdvertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may\nbe submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of\nthe size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first\nten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent\nsubmissions will not be included due to size constraints.\n\nWSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author\ncolumns within WSM.  A C\/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and\ntwo Windows-specific opinion\/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will\nbe on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column\non one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or\nDiegoAA on America Online.\n \nThe first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online,\nCompuserve, and the Internet.

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n\n-- \n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\n*   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

The three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. In a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in February next year at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.  The three firms claim that the Cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. When put inside powerful computer servers, the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second. The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. The first machines off the line using the Cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. A working version of the PS3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. As well as being inside the PlayStation 3, the chip will also be used inside high-definition TVs and powerful computers. \"In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,\" said Ken Kutaragi, Chief Operating Officer of Sony. \"Current PC architecture is nearing its limits.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Minority ethnic led (Mel) production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries, research has suggested.  The study, commissioned by Pact and the UK Film Council, included interviews with industry experts and individuals. They indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies. The research indicated that about 10% of independent production companies in the UK are minority ethnic led.  A minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decision-making power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group. The report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and TV industries. It said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources, so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms. The research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice, plus improved communication within the film and TV sectors. \"The UK has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television,\" said Arts minister Estelle Morris of the findings. \"I welcome this report which I hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The BBC is to invest \u00a39m in developing new comedy and entertainment programmes outside London.  The changes come as part of a shake-up of several departments to create shows that appeal to a wider range of people. Changes are also being made to teams in the factual and daytime departments outside London. Director of television Jana Bennett said the changes were about \"getting the best ideas on screen as efficiently and effectively as we can\". \"The new structure in each genre is designed to ensure that happens,\" she said.  A number of new roles are being created in each department, including a head of comedy commissioning based in Glasgow. The new person will be in charge of the \u00a39m budget and their role will be to develop shows outside the capital, both within the BBC and with independent production companies. Jane Lush, controller of entertainment commissioning, said, \"Entertainment and comedy are incredibly important to our audiences; I'm confident these changes will help us get the very best programmes on screen.\" Similar positions will also be created in the other departments, with the new commissioning editor for documentaries based in Bristol and the daytime commissioning editor in Birmingham. Ms Bennett said the new roles would benefit those making programmes within the BBC as well as those making shows for the channel independently. \"A strong independent sector and a flourishing in-house production base are not mutually exclusive and will stimulate the competition that will deliver the best ideas to the audience,\" she said.

If found guilty Aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about \u00a322,000. The federation had initially declined to take action against Aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in October. But its president Angel Maria Villar changed his mind after a request by Spain's anti-violence commission. Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry's Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive.  \"I never intended to offend anyone, and for that reason I have a very easy conscience,\" he said at the time. \"I'm obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. \"As part of that job, I use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. \" England's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month.  But the storm increased following racist chanting by Spanish fans at England's black players during the game, which Spain won 1-0. Spain's minister of sport Jaime Lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the Federation's decision. \"Everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations, and make sure they do not give a negative image,\" he said. \"We are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}
{"text":" Road trip comedy Sideways has had more praise heaped on it by two US critics' associations, adding to honours it has already picked up.  The Chicago Film Critics Association (CFCA) named it winner in five categories including best film and best actor for Paul Giamatti. But the director award went to Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby. The Southeastern Film Critics also awarded Sideways its best film of the year accolade. Director Alexander Payne was named best director, and he also won best screenplay shared with Jim Taylor. The CFCA awarded Thomas Haden Church the best supporting actor prize and Virginia Madsen the best supporting actress award for their roles in the film.  Sideways has already been voted best film by critics associations in New York and Los Angeles and has been nominated for a Golden Globe. British actress Imelda Staunton won the CFCA best actress for the gritty abortion drama Vera Drake, adding to a growing list of awards she has won for her performance in the Mike Leigh film. Scrubs star Zach Braff was named best new director for his debut Garden State. Michael Moore's controversial documentary Fahrenheit 9\/11 won the best documentary, while A Very Long Engagement won best foreign film. The Chicago critics have yet to name a date for when their awards ceremony will be held. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing\n> to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It\n> is not a hostile action leading to war.\n\nNo one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.\nPalestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about\nanti-trust in the business world.\n\nSince we are debating the legality of a commercial\ntransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines\nand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\n\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic \/\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\nmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims of\nan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist\nmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).\n\n\n>>As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace, maybe.\n>>However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish\n>>state, where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of\n>>the land.

The\n>arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who\n>they vote for as the Jews.\n\nAgain Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get\non a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its\nOK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is\na nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it\nhas an integer square root.\n\n>>Those palestinians who stayed, actually stayed despite of what \n>>happened, and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless\n>>and ineffective minority.\n>>If I were wrong, you'd have Israel recall all the\n>>palestinian refugees (we're talking millions). After all,\n>>they are civilians. \n\n>\tHuh?  The people who left, did so voluntarily.  There is no\n>reason for Israel to let them in.\n\nDo you actually believe this? My experience tells me that\nevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in\nPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an\nescape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with\nyou. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,\njust being rethorical.\n\n\n>>Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it\n>>had to maintain a democratic facade (to keep the western aid\n>>flowing).\n\n>\tIsrael got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It\n>still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how\n>is granting citizenship a facade?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\n'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the\narab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So\nyes, they're there. But as a community with history and\nroots, its dead.\n\n>>\tTell me something, Sam.  What makes land \"arab?\"\n\n>How shall I explain, Its a contract between the man and the\n>land.

{"text":" Church ministers are trying to prevent rapper Nelly performing in Arkansas, saying they do not want his \"vile and filthy lyrics\" in their town.  More than 20 Jonesboro ministers urged music fans to boycott Nelly's 12 March concert at Arkansas State University in a bid to have it cancelled. \"Jonesboro is a wonderful city because of what does not come here,\" said the Reverend Adrian Rodgers. But a venue spokesman said more than 5,500 tickets had been sold so far.  Mr Rodgers, of the Fullness of Joy Church, said he was concerned about the rapper's lyrics that include references to drugs, sex and violence, and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women. Ministers were worried that bringing such acts to Jonesboro would lead to problems. \"Tear the tickets up,\" Mr Rodgers said. \"Do not go and do not allow your children to go.\"  Tim Dean, director of the Arkansas State University venue, said ticket sales had been brisk. \"It would appear that with ticket sales over 5,000, many others have expressed their right to find Nelly's music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on,\" he said. Nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide, and in September 2004 simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the US albums chart. He has had 12 UK hit singles, including Hot in Herre, Dilemma and recent number one Over and Over. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" A bookmaker has stopped taking bets on Celebrity Big Brother after claiming \"sensitive information\" about the Channel 4 show had been leaked.  William Hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on Friday's surprise double eviction. \"This is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess,\" William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said. However, a Big Brother spokeswoman was \"satisfied\" that sensitive information about the show remained confidential.  The bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions, when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1\/14. But William Hill's \"overwhelming evidence\" came on Friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show's surprise double eviction.  Shortly afterwards model Caprice and actor Jeremy Edwards left the show. Mr Adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting, and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next. \"We think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners,\" he said. The bets were not taken. Mr Adams did not believe anyone from Channel 4 or Big Brother producer Endemol had tried to place the queried bets. But he added: \"They need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information.\"  Big Brother's spokeswoman said: \"Only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential. \"We do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective.\" The show's independent adjudicator - the Electoral Reform Services - was also satisfied, she added. The current series of Celebrity Big Brother ends on Sunday, with Happy Mondays star Bez, actress Brigitte Nielsen and Blazin' Squad rapper Kenzie competing for a \u00a350,000 charity prize.  Bookmaker Ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final, with Kenzie its favourite at 2\/9. \"We felt no need whatsoever to close the book,\" spokesman Warren Lush said. \"We've seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns.\" Mr Lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds \"because they think it's like buying money\". \"You do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think there's no chance of an upset they will still do it,\" he said.

If gun control doesn't\nlower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.\n\n>...Even a simpleton knows that\n>he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat...\n\nDoes that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much\nmore common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\nIt isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\ncommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\n\n>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife\n>than a gun, thanks.  \n\n\"Face\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\nusual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts\nto much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your\npockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun\nthan actually stabbed with a knife.\n\n>...Fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't\n>another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have\n>much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife\n>assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants).\n\nActually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in\nunarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman \nwithout much problem.\n\nYou also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime\nSurvey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a\nknife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives\nin a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost\nall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,\nusing (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)\na weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless\nof how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective\nthan guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \"serious threat\"\nnearly as often as they do guns.\n\n                                              Frank Crary\n                                              CU Boulder\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":"From: bharper@cimlinc.uucp (Brett Harper)\nSubject: GUI Application Frameworks for Windows ??\n\nHello,\n  \n  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have\ncome across a few that look good:\n\n  Zapp 1.1 from Inmark\n  Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software\n  C++\/Views from Liant\n  Win++ from Blaise\n\nSome considerations I'm using:\n\n  Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX\/X world), the quality and\nintuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very \nimportant.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows\nprogramming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with\nthe native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the\nsake of changing the API, are valuable.\n\n  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the\nmemory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less\nimportant. \n\n  We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch\ncomponents from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff\n (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.\n\nThe two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two\ntoolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if\nanyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).\n\nA couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:\n\nZApp\n----\n  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and\n    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.\n  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\n  Redirectable graphics display\/output architecture (useful for printing)\n  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.\n  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.\n \nZinc\n----\n  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)\n  Comes with a interface builder tool\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\n  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.  \n  Had a better demo :-)\n\nBoth have source code availability options\nBoth are lacking OLE support\nNeither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff\n\n\nAny thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,\n\nThanks,\n  Brett Harper\n\n\nbrett.harper@cimlinc.com\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}
{"text":" Fake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts.  Trust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.  \"I don't think the threat is overplayed,\" Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the BBC News website. He added: \"The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.\" Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. \"Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, they will indemnify us,\" he said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.  On average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.  Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcard's method is more complex. It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.  \"The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both.\" The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. \"You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. \"If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction.\" The clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. \"Each individual gets a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,\" said Mr Ash. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. \"By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,\" according to Mr Ash. In the next few years, Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. \"PCs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards.\" The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. \"The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,\" he said.

{"text":" The 77th annual Academy Awards are taking place on 27 February with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. But from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today?  HOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.  Just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.  The first film to win was Wings, which starred Clara Bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. For the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the Los Angeles Times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. As a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. WHEN AND WHERE The tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.  The ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre the first to host the expanded event. Other venues included the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium. They are now held at the Kodak Theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. Until 1954 they were held on a Thursday, then swapped around from Monday to Wednesday before Sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from May to April to March and now its current month of February. The first televised ceremony was in 1953, with Bob Hope as the MC. WHO WAS OSCAR? There is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as Oscar.  One popular story is that Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said the statue looked like her uncle Oscar. A journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.  The first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist Sidney Skolsky used it to describe Katherine Hepburn's first best actress win in 1934. The Academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. The trophy was designed by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons. Since its inception 2,530 Oscars have been handed out. In support of the war effort, the Academy handed out plaster Oscar statuettes during WWII. After the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. Fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. Winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. WHO SITS IN JUDGEMENT? The Academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. Douglas Fairbanks Sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. There are now 5,700 members of the Academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. THE STARS WHO LEFT EMPTY-HANDED While many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the Academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.  Among the overlooked films were Hobson's Choice, Dirty Harry, The 39 Steps, The Searchers and King Kong. Actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included Al Jolson in the Jazz Singer (1927), Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1944), Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952) and Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men (1957). Alfred Hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. His enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. THE SHOW ALWAYS GOES ON Not even war has halted the glittering Hollywood event. There were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in Iraq, but as it didn't stop during World War II or the Vietnam war.  Documentary winner Michael Moore ensured nobody forgot about the Iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the American invasion. The ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. The ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. Los Angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. The death of Martin Luther King saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. CONTROVERSIES AND OTHER GAFFES Three people have refused Oscars, including actor George C Scott who said the whole thing was \"demeaning\". Writer Dudley Nichols refused his Academy Award in 1935 for his screenplay for The Insider because the Writers' Guild was striking at the time. Marlon Brando turned down his best actor Oscar for The Godfather in 1973 in protest as Hollywood's apparent discrimination against Native American people. He sent along a woman called Sacheen Littlefeather to collect his award. She was later revealed to be Native American actress Maria Cruz.  The following year Robert Opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. The TV network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. Opal was murdered in 1979. Frank Capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared \"come on up and get it, Frank\" to which Frank Capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant Frank Lloyd had won for Cavalcade.  Capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for It Happened One Night. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England's Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.  The Leicester tight-head is in the form of his life, making the England number three shirt his own. But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. \"The Welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.\" White is also impressed with the Welsh pack's strength in depth. \"Gethin Jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. He has played a bit at tight-head but I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,\" he added. The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  He destroyed South Africa's Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by White's presence this season. The Tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the Premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the Heineken Cup. \"I am pleased with my form,\" he said. \"But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree. \"It's been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants. \"I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.\" White is now one of the more experienced members of the England squad which takes to the field on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.  And with 27 caps and a World Cup winner's medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon. \"I don't know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,\" he added. \"When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.  \"It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. \"I was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.\" White missed the vast majority of last year's Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in Cardiff. \"I enjoy the atmosphere. The Millennium Stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world,\" he said. \"To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it's one of my favourite places to play. \"This is probably the most even Six Nations for a long time. England, Ireland, France and Wales are all contenders. \"On form, Ireland should be favourites but you just don't know - that's the great thing about this tournament.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\nnew Jew who has \"learned\" to work it. Both aspects of the\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\n\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It\nhas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to\nproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this\nconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the\nclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of\nEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, \"I have no tears for those who\nget rich off of cheap labor\". 2) to furnish an answer to the\nunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for\nwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\n\nThe Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from\nthe far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work in\ntheir own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two\nethnical communities and ruling over them.\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

So as we \nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \n11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \n12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the \nvarious groups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A photo op with Vessey?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \nno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President been given any information by the \nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \nVietnamese on that subject?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \nof business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll \ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't \ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's \nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \nabout first.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \nyesterday about the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many times?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind \nof an agreement on a jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \nway flexible on this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going \nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll \ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \nkind of an agreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it \nas he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs \npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \nwe reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the \nmoment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress \nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other \nRepublicans yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I \nwouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were led to believe that the President called \nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \nbut it was both.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In the President's mind, are they linked \npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what \narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \npackage, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs \npackage through the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \nnow with Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \nSenate for the jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other \nthan Shelby?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a \nvote.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about Kohl?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Kohl and Feingold?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll \ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, \nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \nfunding if this jobs package doesn't pass.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \nother Republicans again today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but \nagain, I wouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \nany other states today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of \nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \nthink it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \nup, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \nhow their states would benefit from this package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you share those with us?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent \nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \nbeen given?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think \nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \nhas not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add \nto that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going \nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't \nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public \ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think \nI want to add to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In February, though, the President said that this \nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \nchange its mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They're \nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \nspecific options that will be covered by the President's health care \nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \non it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being \nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President's \ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then suddenly --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \ntax.\n\n\t     Q\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \nhasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \nlooking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and \nno decisions have been made.\n\n\t     Q\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \ntask force is working.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \nall options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're \nconsidering all options.\n\n\t     Q\t  But that's not the impression that the President \nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \nnot on the table, not an option. \n\n\t     Q\t  \"If it changes I'll tell you.\"\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Bring him on.\n\n\t     Q\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President's \nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna \nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \n--\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a \nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \ncouple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We \nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Is it because he has very few options?\n\n\t     Q\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the \ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \nthe President?  \n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at \nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \ncontext, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been \nmade, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a \ndecision on.\n\n\t     Q\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \nthough he specifically ruled it out?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \nthis form of taxation?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The \nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \nthey're looking at is the VAT. \n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \nthat you were telling us that it was not?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of \ntheir drafting of options is.  I don't know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \nconsideration?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's \ncomments.\n\n\t     Q\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise \nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made \non how to pay for the health care plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm asking whether the projections --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how \nthe plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going \nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \nyou can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \nuntil you know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer \nmodels on a number of possible packages.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \n\n\t     Q\t  The question is whether they have now determined \nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're \nnot going to answer until -- there's a number of options being \nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \n--\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \nin his --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \nnature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular \nbriefings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, you have.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not \nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \nhim as an option.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of \nwhat's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't \nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of \npaying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  \nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \nit's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process \nof the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  \nIt's something that the working groups will present to him among the \nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not \ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \nhealth care issues are being discussed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's your statement from this podium that no \ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \nthe option has not been presented to him.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \nby George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \nnothing to add to what's already been said.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \nso that it would be less regressive?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what \nmight happen if.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \nyou'd exclude food and energy --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific \nstructure of a decision that hasn't been made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's \ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \ngroups?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you check for us, because that's a real \nimportant credibility question?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since the task force was brought together this \nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \nand a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be \nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  \nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \nadd.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if \nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \nit's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \nus.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come \nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or \ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about \nthis issue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All we were trying to find out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out \nand I've given you the answers, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made \nit an option again.  That's the --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you \ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously \nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll \npresent it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \nthe table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \nhis mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he change his mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a \ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's \nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \nthis we'll let you know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he \nchanged his mind or the working groups think they're authority \nexceeds the President's.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to look at all options; they've done that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \navailable. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will \nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \nthrough the questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the \npresidential tax forms.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could we have one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of \na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \nyour questions about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they file a joint form?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When did he file it?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \nMiyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No backgrounder today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \none day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \nforce in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it \nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards \nBosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight \ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've \ninitiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \nalthough we're considering a number of options right now.  If the \nSerbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on \nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \nwhich we've been saying regularly.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them \nevery day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Which doesn't work so --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \nWe're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \nthe 26th.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us \nany documentation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to \nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been no -- you have not been able to \nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia \nand we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be \nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \nyou'd like.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't \nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \nprovide something along those lines?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the \ndetails of that package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \nget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the \n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering \nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \nconcern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \nin the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit \nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to \nwork with Congress to make that happen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \nthis process moves forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \nCongress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs \npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \ngive kids something to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who are they?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three \norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \nof Police Associations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \n$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So this would be the $700 million that's in the \nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

{"text":" Coronation Street has become the first soap to triumph at the South Bank Show Awards, which traditionally reward highbrow and groundbreaking culture.  The soap beat fellow ITV1 show Filthy Love and Channel 4's Shameless to win the best TV drama prize on Thursday. Little Britain was named best comedy while Franz Ferdinand beat Morrissey and The Libertines to the music award. Shane Meadows' Dead Man's Shoes picked up the best film award, beating Shaun of the Dead and My Summer of Love. The two award ceremonies reflect the achievements the industry believes have been made in the last year.  In 2004, Coronation Street pulled away from its BBC One rival EastEnders in the ratings and dominated other TV awards. Last year, the South Bank Award for best TV drama went to Steven Poliakoff's period piece The Lost Prince, while Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 killings in Northern Ireland, won in 2003. In other South Bank categories, Little Britain's second series beat Nighty Night and The Green Wing to the comedy trophy while Alan Bennett's The History Boys won in the theatre category. Author David Mitchell made up for losing out in the Booker Prize to Alan Hollinghurst by beating him to the literary award with his book Cloud Atlas. Shameless, State Of Play and Clocking Off creator Paul Abbott got a lifetime achievement award while former Grange Hill actress Amma Asante won the breakthrough award for writing and directing her first film, A Way Of Life.

That is the \nprime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue.\nSince the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act and\nthe registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection.\nU.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular\nauthority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can not\narbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into\neffect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality\nof law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was \nnever constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be\nunconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law\nbeing unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct\nme if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone\nconvicted of breaking that law is absolved.\n   I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.  NFA has been\ninvalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellate\nlevel{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory  and U.S. vs Dalton}).\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Slovakia will play Argentina in the final of the Hopman Cup after beating Group B rivals the Netherlands 3-0.  Daniela Hantuchova defeated Michaella Krajicek 6-4 6-2 to give the Slovaks the perfect start before Dutchman Peter Wessels retired against Dominik Hrbaty. Wessels was unable to compete in the mixed doubles but Slovakia had already booked their place in the final for the second year running. Argentina claimed top spot in Group A with three wins from three matches. In the other Group B match, the United States defeated Australia 2-1.  Meghann Shaughnessy lost the opening match against Alicia Molik but James Blake levelled the tie with a 6-3 6-4 win over Paul Baccanello, who came in as a replacement for the injured Mark Philippoussis. Blake and Shaughnessy then beat Molik and Baccanello in a tense mixed doubles contest to take the win. Hantuchova, who did not win a Hopman Cup singles match in 2004, has been in good form during this year's event and has won two of her three matches. \"I feel like it's really deserved this time as I've helped Dominik to get through,\" she said. \"I think if I keep going the way I have been in the past few matches then I will be okay. \"I was really pleased with my last two singles, even the first one, which was a really high standard. \"You can't ask for a better preparation than to play a few matches here for the Australian Open.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.  Howl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (\u00a37.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Rags strewed the mud floor around an \n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face \n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \n as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

He yawned.\n 'Did you see any Turk officers?'\n 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'\n\n \"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \n Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\n so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \n laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last \n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \n looms, even spinning-wheels.\n\n 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must \n leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And \n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \n Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\"\n\np. 354.\n\n\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n\"It will be three hours to take,\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\n\"But the women and children?\"\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\n\np. 360.\n\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\"\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble \n where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet \n had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n \"...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled\n  north.

Daniela Hantuchova put the third seeds ahead, recovering from a terrible start to beat Gisela Dulko 1-6 6-4 6-4. Dominik Hrbaty, who had not lost a set in his three singles matches in the group stages, then upset world number seven Guillermo Coria 6-4 6-1. Hantuchova and Hrbaty then won the mixed doubles after Coria was forced to withdraw because of a sore back. Slovakia's win made up for last year's final defeat to the United States. \"I would like to congratulate Daniela,\" Hrbaty said. \"I was so nervous watching her today, I almost had a heart attack. \"I also feel a little sorry for Guillermo because I get very excited whenever I play for my country. I show lots of emotions and played such good tennis.\"  World number 31 Hantuchova, ranked two places above Dulko, looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match. Dulko, who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages, grew in confidence and took the opening set in just 27 minutes. But Hantuchova hit back to take the next two and the match. \"I was so nervous because I really wanted to win for the team and for Dominik as he played so well all week,\" she said. \"I didn't think I was playing my best but I just tried to hang in there and fight hard for every point for my country.\" Slovakia won the Cup on their first appearance in 1998 when Karol Kucera and Karina Habsudova beat France.

{"text":" Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.  It took $40.8m (\u00a321m) in weekend ticket sales, according to studio estimates. The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week's number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (\u00a38.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.  Ocean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (\u00a319.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (\u00a395.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It's just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (\u00a357.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\". A milder review in the New York Times dubbed the sequel \"unabashedly trivial\". ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" It is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.  When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially. But, says Nick Donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at IBM, it was not \"the thing\" itself that actually improved people's lives. It was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. The car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access. \"When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century, we have to think more like this, but faster,\" Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website, after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture. \"The invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. \"The equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did.\" These are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.  We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues Mr Donofrio, Industry Week's 2003 Technology Leader of the Year. The hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.  \"In the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. \"Somebody had a new thing that would awe you. You weren't quite sure that it did anything, you weren't quite sure if you needed it, you weren't quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool.\" But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be \"in your face\". It will creep in pervasively. Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage. \"I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,\" says Mr Donofrio. Pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards. The net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air. \"People will not have to do anything to stay connected. People will know their lives are just better,\" says Mr Donofrio. \"Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.\" Natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances.  Ultimately, there will be, says Mr Donofrio, no value in being \"computer illiterate\". To some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad. To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen. Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and \"deep computing\", says Mr Donofrio. Deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing. It has value, according to IBM, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates.  But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world. As computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.  This is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. \"I am confident that the SET [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills,\" he says. \"If I am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. \"Women tend to have those traits a lot better than men.\" Eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says. In the UK, a DTI-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on SET industry boards. IBM, according to Mr Donofrio, has 30%. \"Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career.\" The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio. \"We believe in the whole issue of global diversity,\" he says. \"Our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse. They expect us to look like them. \"As more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.

{"text":" The next-generation DVD format Blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival, according to its backers.  Blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games. The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format. The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound. This offers incredible 3D-like quality of pictures which major Hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. In a separate press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toshiba announced that DVD players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.  \"As we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images, we have a much greater need for storage,\" Richard Doherty, from Panasonic's Hollywood Laboratories, one of the pioneers of Blu-ray, told the BBC news website. \"So by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's DVD.\" A Blu-ray disc will be able to store 50GB of high-quality data, while Toshiba's HD-DVD will hold 30GB. Mr Doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the DVDs and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. Both Toshiba and Blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging DVD format war, akin to the Betamax and VHS fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation DVD players start to come out. When players do come out, they will be able to play standard DVDs too, which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current DVDs.  But the support from Vivendi and Electronics Arts is a big boost to Blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.  Gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide, so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. \"The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies,\" said Michael Heilmann, chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal. \"Blu-ray offers the capacity, performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.\" EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. Sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of PlayStations. Mr Doherty said gamers were \"ravenous\" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. \"Gamers, especially those working on PCs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback.\"  He added: \"The focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion.  \"Gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3D models and textures and increasing the resolution, increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.\" Fitting these models on current DVD technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. As games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting. \"They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments,\" said Mr Doherty. Currently, graphics-intensive PC games also require multiple discs for installation. High-definition DVDs will cut down on that need. Likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. Blu-ray has already won backing from major Hollywood studios, such as MGM Studios, Disney, and Buena Vista, as well as top technology firms like Dell, LG, Samsung and Phillips amongst others. While Toshiba's HD-DVD technology has won backing from Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. \"The real world benefits (of HD-DVD) are apparent and obvious,\" said Jim Cardwell, president of Warner Home Video. Mr Cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with HD-DVD. Both formats are courting Microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation Xbox, but discussions are still on-going. Next generation DVDs will also be able to store images and other data. CES is the largest consumer electronics show in the world, and runs from 6 to 9 January. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Wayne Rooney made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter-finals.  Rooney received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from Quinton Fortune and Cristiano Ronaldo silenced the jeers at Goodison Park. Fortune headed home after 23 minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes' free-kick. Marcus Bent missed Everton's best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.  Rooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And Rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent, played onside by Gabriel Heintze, hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when Ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert, but Martyn dived to save brilliantly. And Martyn came to Everton's rescue three minutes later when Rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. Scholes' free-kick took a deflection, and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. Everton's problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. Rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by Martyn in injury-time when he outpaced Stubbs, but once again Martyn denied the England striker.  - Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson: \"It was a fantastic performance by us. In fairness I think Everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. \"The boy Ronaldo is a fantastic player. He's persistent and never gives in. \"I don't know how many fouls he had He gets up and wants the ball again, he's truly a fabulous player.\" Everton: Martyn, Hibbert, Yobo, Stubbs, Naysmith, Osman, Carsley, Arteta, Kilbane, McFadden, Bent.

{"text":" Referee Graham Poll said he applied the laws of the game in allowing Arsenal striker Thierry Henry's free-kick in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Chelsea.  Keeper Petr Cech was organising his defensive wall when Henry's quick free-kick flew in, which angered Chelsea. \"The whistle doesn't need to be blown. I asked Henry 'do you want a wall?'. He said 'can I take it please?' He was very polite. I said 'yes',\" said Poll. \"I deal with the laws of the game. I deal with fact.\" Poll added: \"I gave the signal for him to take it. That's what he did. \"The same thing happened when I refereed Chelsea against West Ham in an FA Cup replay two years ago - when Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored - and I don't remember them complaining about that.\" Henry explained why he paused before striking the ball for the goal, which put Arsenal 2-1 ahead.  Henry told BBC Radio Five Live: \"The ref asked me if I wanted 10 yards or if I wanted to take it straight away and I said that I wanted to take it straight away. He said to me, 'go'. \"It looks a bit strange because I took my time. I was waiting for Eidur Gudjohnsen to move and give me some space. \"At one point, he turned and that's when I tried it.\" Former referees' chief Philip Don backed Poll's decision to allow the strike. \"The advantage should go to the non-offending team. On this occasion it was Arsenal,\" Don told BBC Radio Five Live. \"Referees have been told to ask the player 'do you want to take the quick free-kick?' or 'do you want me to get the wall back 9.15 metres?' \"If they say 'quick', the referee tends to move away and allow the kick.\" Don was head of the referees for the Premier League and revealed all clubs were informed of free-kick options. \"We spoke to all the Premier League clubs as well as all the Football League clubs in the summer of 2003 explaining what the situation was,\" he added \"We gave them the option of either the quick free-kick or the 'ceremonial' free-kick.

{"text":" Ticket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002's all-time high.  Overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year's Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9\/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.  \"Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,\" said Mr Dergarabedian. He added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as Napoleon Dynamite and critical hit Sideways. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice chairman. Jeff Blake said: \"We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge.\" Horror movie The Grudge cost Sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. It's the latest in a recent trend for Hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market, whilst ignoring the middle. Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

I was stongly\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around\nwith the hassles of beta software.

{"text":" Computer giant IBM says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community.  The move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for a licence from the company. IBM described the step as a \"new era\" in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available. The patents include software for a range of practices, including text recognition and database management. Traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite IBM's announcement the company continues to follow this route.  IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports. For each of the past 12 years IBM has been granted more US patents than any other company. IBM has received 25,772 US patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents. In a statement, Dr John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: \"True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. It's about innovating to benefit customers, partners and society.  \"Our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how IBM will manage intellectual property.\" In the past, IBM has supported the non-commercial operating system Linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine Microsoft.  The company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a \"patent commons\". Adam Jollans, IBM's world-wide Linux strategy manager, said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation. \"We believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly. \"This is about encouraging collaboration and following a model much like academia.\" Mr Jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration. \"The internet's impact has been on everyone. The benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of.\" Stuart Cohen, chief executive of US firm Open Source Development Labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents.  \"I think other companies will follow suit,\" he said. But not everyone was as supportive. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial. \"It's just diversionary tactics,\" wrote Mr Mueller, who leadsnosoftwarepatents.com, in a message on the group's website. \"Let's put this into perspective: We're talking aboutroughly one percent of IBM's worldwide patent portfolio. They filethat number of patents in about a month's time,\" he added. IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents. The company said it would not place any restrictions on companies, groups or individuals who use them in open-source projects. Open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code - the origins of the program - for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software. End users have the right to modify and redistribute the software, as well as the right to package and sell the software. Other areas covered by the patents released by IBM include storage management, simultaneous multiprocessing, image processing, networking and e-commerce. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.  It has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.  People who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual \u00a350 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit \u00a3750.\"  Phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.  Telecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.  Gavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.  I use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.  Ignorance is and always has been an expensive business.  Does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?  These diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!  Part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.  These scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?  Why don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.  Disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!  I was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!  I have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over \u00a31,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.  I have been scammed of \u00a3139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.  Premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.  I know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.  It's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.  I haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.  My telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal \u00a33 to \u00a35, to \u00a3320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over \u00a3300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.  How about an automatic monthly cap of say \u00a320 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off \u00a320 than it is \u00a3750.  A few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.  How about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Andy Roddick has ended an 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert which yielded the US Open title and saw the American become world number one.  Roddick released a statement through the SFX Sports Group with the news but did not give a reason for the split. \"The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time,\" said Roddick. \"Any more on this situation's a private matter between coach and player.\" Roddick won 121 of his 147 matches while working with Gilbert, and said he had enjoyed their time together. He won his first Grand Slam event at Flushing Meadows last year, and finished 2003 on top of the ATP Tour rankings.  But Roddick slipped to second this year behind Roger Federer, who became the first man since 1988 to win three Majors in a season. Federer, who has not had a coach since he split from Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick to win the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals. Roddick hired Gilbert after deciding to part from coach Tarik Benhabiles in the wake of his first-round exit at the 2003 French Open. He went on to win the US Open and four other titles for the year. He has won four events this season. \"I have enjoyed all of my time with Andy,\" Gilbert said on his personal website. \"He has been a great student of the game during the time that we worked together and I am very proud of the results that were achieved. \"While I believe that there is still a great deal of work to be done, Andy clearly does not feel that way.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

The figures, from e-mail management firm Email Systems, will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. While virus traffic has slowed down, denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. Virus mail accounts for just over 15% of all e-mail traffic analysis by the firm has found.  It is no longer just multi-nationals that are in danger of so-called denial of service attacks, in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. Email Systems refers to a small UK-based engineering firm, which received a staggering 12 million e-mails in January. The type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months, according to Email Systems analysis. Half of spam received since Christmas has been health-related with gambling and porn also on the increase. Scam mails, offering ways to make a quick buck, have declined by 40%. \"January is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities,\" said Neil Hammerton, managing director of Email Systems. \"Spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this, focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers, presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar,\" he said.

{"text":" A British Muslim group has criticised the new series of US drama 24, which is about to be aired on Sky One, claiming it portrays Islam unfairly.  The Muslim Council of Britain has complained to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. It says the programme breaches editorial guidelines. The group's members met with Sky executives on Tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes. The drama, now in its fourth series, begins on Sunday evening. The new series portrays a Muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell. The Muslim Council of Britain said in a statement: \"We are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of Muslims in this series of 24 based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen.\" \"There is not a single positive Muslim character in the storyline to date. At a time when negative stereotypes of Muslims are on the increase we feel that Sky - as a major UK broadcaster - has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views, not help to reinforce them.\" But Sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines. A spokesperson said: \"During a useful meeting yesterday, Sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council. Sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach Ofcom's programme code.\" Fox TV, which shows the series in the US, is broadcasting public service announcements showing Muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series.

{"text":" New comedy Diary of a Mad Black Woman has ended Will Smith's reign at the top of the North American box office.  Based on a play by Tyler Perry, who also stars as a gun-toting grandmother, the film took $22.7m (\u00a311.8m) in its first three days of release. After topping the chart for two consecutive weeks, Smith's romantic comedy Hitch dropped to second place with takings of $21m (\u00a310.9m). Keanu Reeves' supernatural thriller Constantine dropped a place to three. Based on the Hellblazer comics, the film took $11.8m (\u00a36.1m) on its second week of release. Two new entries came next in the chart, with Wes Craven's horror movie Cursed, about a werewolf loose in Los Angeles, in fourth position with $9.5m (\u00a34.9m).  Action comedy Man of the House, starring Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas ranger assigned to protect a cheerleader squad, came in at fifth with $9m (\u00a34.6m). Clint Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby - recipient of four Academy Awards, including best picture - continued to perform well in sixth place with takings of $7.2m (\u00a33.74m). Martin Scorsese's Hollywood biopic The Aviator - which won five Oscars, all in minor categories - held on in ninth place. The low-budget feature Diary of a Mad Black Woman stars Kimberly Elise as a woman thrown out on the streets by her philandering husband. With the help of her grandmother Madea (one of three roles played by Perry), she plots revenge. Perry, 34, is one of America's best-known black playwrights but is a newcomer to film. Once made homeless after investing his own money in unsuccessful productions of his work, he now lives in the mansion in which Diary of a Mad Black Woman was filmed. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

After a day or two of work I often find myself down under\n    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than\n    my shell running.\n\n    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some\n    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  \n\n    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are\n    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at\n    plugging this leak?\n\n    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?\n\n    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with\n    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a\n    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.\n\n    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?

{"text":" A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard (HP), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.  The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.  But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. \"The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,\" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months. The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as \u00a334 but it could cost up to \u00a31,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year. The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.

You see,\nwhat one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.\n\n>If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,\n>or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.\n\nAgain, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \"worth\"\nis subjective. \n\n>#If you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\n>#be a good beginning.\n\n>I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective\n>basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in\n>dealing with observed facts.

Having actual existance.\n3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\nobservable phenomenon.\n\nBy this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the\nphrase \"objective worth\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a \nlittle differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a\nnotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\nthus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \n\"good\") is subjective.\n\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time\nand read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,\nvalue, morality, good, evil.

I moved there from\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\n\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \neven considered such an idea possible.\n\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\n\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\nArmenian SSR.\n\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\n\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\n\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\n\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\n\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \nover their apartments.\"\n\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \ninvolved.\n\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\n\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\n\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\n\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \nArmenian?\"\n\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \nthe information into the urn.\"\n\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\n\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \naffair.\n\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\n\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . .

But I \nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \nwithdraw protection from the city altogether?

{"text":" Only one man recognises that robots are a threat to humanity - but that's fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller I, Robot.  Will Smith co-stars alongside more CGI robots than you can count and as a thrill-a-minute kind of action film, it's perfectly adequate. You'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extras. There is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a Making Of but the two-disc adds more. Unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects. They're covered but there's also a general Production Diary and a Post-Production feature.  Remember the National Lottery's draw machines Arthur and Guinevere? They were more accurate than this glossy Hollywood version of the tale.  But as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it: King Arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent. Clive Owen is the brooding king, Keira Knightly rises above her costume and Ray Winstone gives it all some grit. It's at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the Making Of extra.  Less flashy than a David Attenborough show and less detailed than a Simon Schama one, the BBC series British Isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. Admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows Alan Titchmarsh left Ground Force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy. But Titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present-day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating. He's now written an accompanying book, too.

The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? \n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nThe longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles\nand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have\nordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\n|1|\n\nHELSINKI WATCH: \"PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE\"\n\nAnkara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the \"Helsinki Watch\"  it is\nstated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced\nwith problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being\nimplemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.\n\nThe report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government\nshould grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of\nminorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and\nin addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \"Turkish\nMinority\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify\nthemselves as 'Turks'.\n\nNEWSPOT, May 1992\n\n|2|\n\nGREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS\n\nThe  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek\nstate is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish\nminority with Turkey.\n\nPointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is\ncalled \"Greek\"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the\nminority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with\nthe Greek  newspaper \"Ethnos\" he said:  \"I am a Greek  citizen of\nTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western\nTrace are also Turkish.\"\n\nEmphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in\nWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement\nsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey\nin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.\n\nRecalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.\nSadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,\nFaikoglu said.  \"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights.\"\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n|3|\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.

We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling.\"\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\nare over.\n\n================================================================\n                M.

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\n          PHIGS\".\n\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\n          based on PHIGS.\n\n          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.\n\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\n\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\n          mainframes.\n\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\n          and translucency.\n\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\n\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\n          and SGI GL\/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\n\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS\/PEX developers.\n\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\n          Starbase.\n\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller\/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.

And the 'Islamic Holocaust'\nis much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during \nthe period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, \nassisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people \nbecause of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts \nof sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, \nset up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts \nbehind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly \nattacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population \nindiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent \nMuslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with \naxes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt\nalive as can be seen below.\n\nWidespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions \nof Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and \nMaras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,\nalso had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from \nbehind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of \nEastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed \nwidespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena\nwas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from \nErzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide \nby Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, \nRussian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French \njournalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century\ncommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.\n\nThe Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, \nKars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their \nvillages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.\nThe massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for\nhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,\nAustrian, French and American authorities.\n\nAlmost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and \ncruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by \nArmenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish \nand Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. \nEven today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of \nthe victims of these cruelties can be heard.\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        \"Document No: 76,\" Archive No: 1\/2, Cabin No: 109, Drawer \n        No: 3, File No: 346, Section No: 427(1385), Contents No: 3, 52-53.\n        (To Lt.

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are \n speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as \n well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is \n proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\"\n\n                                                     Dr. Stephan Eshnanie\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

{"text":"From: Thyagi@cup.portal.com (Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva)\nSubject: Re: OTO, the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars\n\n930418\n\nDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.]\nThe word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]\n\n\nDoes one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\n\nI am I!\n\nFrater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}
{"text":" Oscar host Chris Rock said he will steer clear of bad language when he fronts the awards on 27 February.  The comedian, who recently got into trouble for poking fun at the ceremony, is renowned for his heavy use of expletives during his stand-up routine. The live ceremony will be broadcast with a transmission delay on US network ABC to ensure swear words are removed. \"I've been on TV and been funny not cursing,\" he said during an interview for CBS network's 60 Minutes show. \"As far as content is concerned, I will talk about the movies. I'm not really worried about it. I'm sure ABC might be more worried about it than me,\" he added.  The 40-year-old comedian caused a furore when he said in an interview with US magazine Entertainment Weekly recently that he hardly ever watched the Oscars and labelled awards ceremonies \"idiotic\". The show's producers defended Rock and confirmed that he would still be presenting the Oscar ceremony, saying his comments were \"humorous digs\". Meanwhile, the Academy has announced that Oscar-nominated actress Natalie Portman will present an award at the ceremony. Portman, who has been nominated for a best supporting actress gong for her role in Mike Nichols' Closer, joins a growing list of stars set to bestow an award at the ceremony including Dustin Hoffman, Drew Barrymore, Renee Zellweger and British-born actress Kate Winslet.

{"text":" Toulouse's former Irish international Trevor Brennan could be one of Clive Woodward's many surprises when the 44-man Lions tour squad is announced.  Brennan, who last played for Ireland against Samoa in 2001, is held in high esteem by the former England coach. \"If you speak to the players there's a huge amount of respect for the guy,\" Woodward told the Sunday Independent. \"Players tend to know better than most coaches. It's not just the Irish, but Welsh and English players as well.\" The 31-year-old former Dublin milkman moved from Leinster to Toulouse in 2003 and immediately picked up a Heineken Cup winner's medal in an all-French final against Perpignan at Lansdowne Road.  Brennan is highly-rated at Stade Toulousain, where he is used anywhere in the back five. Woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to New Zealand in June are as thorough as possible. \"I've spoken to quite a few players, and they probably don't know what they're actually saying when we're having these conversations,\" he told the newspaper. \"But you talk about certain players and they'll say if they think they're up to scratch or that they don't want them in their team. \"I haven't heard a bad word said against Trevor, which, considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation, is, to me, impressive.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on \"Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile\".  I'll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\nI sprang for Word.\n\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\n\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\n\nThanks,\nBrent Casavant\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\n\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas.  The Scot initially defended Beattie, whose dismissal put Everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0, saying Gallas overreacted. But he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. He said: \"I believe that I should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct.\" Moyes added: \"My comments on Saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when I had only had the opportunity to see one, very quick re-run of the incident.\"  The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas \"would have stayed down a lot longer\" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised. Moyes continued: \"Although the incident was totally out of character - James has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates. \"James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. He will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. \"He is a competitive player but a fair player and I know how upset he is by what has happened. However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily.\" Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: \"I don't think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.  \"Not in a million years would John Terry have gone down in the same way. I have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. \"What has happened to big, strong centre-halves? I thought it was a push initially and I still don't think it was a sending-off.\" An angry Beattie initially said: \"He (Gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if I had headbutted him. \"I can tell you it wasn't an intentional headbutt. We were chasing a ball into the corner and William Gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. \"He was stopping as we were running and I said to myself 'if you're going to stay in my way I'll go straight over you'.

What happened most of the time is that\nMorris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,\nthis is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better\nthe rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes\nconsistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the\nteam's credit.\n\nFurthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would\nbe projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done\nthis in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot\nworse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.\nDo you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.\n\nLook at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical\nMorris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not\nresponsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team\njust didn't rescue him enough.

{"text":" New York electro-rock group The Bravery have come top of the BBC News website's Sound of 2005 poll to find the music scene's most promising new act.  The Bravery, who have been compared to The Cure and New Order, were the most heavily-tipped act in the survey of 110 impartial critics and broadcasters. Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003. Other new artists in this year's list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third. The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen.  They were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it was released in the UK in November. Singer Sam Endicott said he felt \"great\" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list. \"Anyone that says they don't want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass, a liar,\" he said. One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were \"spiky but in love with pop\". Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music's chart show, said the band had \"great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound\". \"The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent,\" he said. Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set \"sounded like a potential single\".  Unconditional reached the summit of the station's listeners' chart within a fortnight of its first play, which Mr Harding described as \"an unheard of achievement for a debut single\".  Q magazine reviews editor Ted Kessler said they were \"pretty-boy New York clothes horses\" with \"an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes\". Other pundits to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin. Elsewhere on the top 10, second-placed rock band Bloc Party began their rise after supporting Franz Ferdinand and UK garage MC Kano, in third, is signed to The Streets' record label. US rapper The Game is hip-hop great Dr Dre's latest protege while Leeds group Kaiser Chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a Britpop revival. In last year's survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point.  Boy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UK's best-selling album of 2004, were seventh. In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor. Those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top 10. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Comedy Meet The Fockers has held on to the number one spot at the North American box office for a second week.  It took $42.8m (\u00a323.7m) at the weekend, making its overall takings more than $163m (\u00a390m) in 12 days, according to studio estimates. It took $19.1m (\u00a39.9m) on Christmas Day alone, the highest takings on that day in box office history. The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industry's tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"We've had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note,\" said Mr Dergarabedian.  Meet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year's Eve, when it made $12.2m (\u00a36.2m), and New Year's Day, when it took $18m (\u00a39.4m). The previous New Year's Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $8.5m (\u00a34.5m). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had held the New Year's Day title with $12.8m (\u00a36.7m). However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003's figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year. This weekend's top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (\u00a365.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year. But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (\u00a37.7m). The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, ended up in third position after taking $11.2m (\u00a35.9m).

{"text":" Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.  Founding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.  \"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.

I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database\nformat used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores\nthe points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a \nlittle and it seems that the points are stored in the order\nthey are drawn.\n\nDoes the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the \npoints are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,\nbut if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know \nwhich direction the polygon should be visible from.\n\nIf DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?\nThe best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one\nin the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that\ndoubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...\n\nThanks in advance for any help,\n\nPatrice\nhugo@hydra.unm.edu \n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":"From: stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de (Stefan Eckart)\nSubject: dmpeg10.zip info: Another DOS MPEG decoder\/player posted\n\n\nI have posted a DOS MPEG decoder\/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.\n\nHere is a short description and some technical information, taken from the\naccompanying documentation:\n\n\n                              DMPEG V1.0\n\n                       Public Domain MPEG decoder\n\n                           by Stefan Eckart\n\n\n0. Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG\/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder\/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code \/ small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+\/-0.25 (instead of +\/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n\n--\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

Only\nTV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \"You say that we\nteach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen\nto a child who sees this ?\" And once again he wraps himself in a\nlengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in\nthe field of rubble that was once his home. The term\n'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of\nwhat he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a\nhouse and shreds of belongings.\n\nOnce again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday\nthere was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF\nforces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles\nand placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I\nhave gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more\nhorrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of\nhouses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely\ndemolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more\nbrutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the\nresidents were still told to remove their valuables from their\nhomes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the\nhandcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied\nwith some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to\nstand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were\neven allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just\ngold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,\nsome 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind\ntheir backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants\non their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their\nhearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their\nhomes, one after the other.\n\n(...)\n\nDr. Juma'a Fuad Said al-Rubi. the brother from Saudi Arabia,\nemerges from among the ruins. Ten days ago he arrived for a family\nvisit, mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his\nfather and brothers. On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyone\nelse for 12 hours, and later went with everyone to view the\ndestrucion. He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he\nis a physician, but only got a shove.  Like all the rest he also\nurinated in his pants, while standing with his hands bound and his\neyes blindfolded for the entire day. Juma'a al-Rubi studied\nmedicine at Cairo University, and for ten years he has been\ntreating wealthy Saudis in Medina. His wife and four children\nremained there.

{"text":" French actress Audrey Tautou, star of hit film Amelie, will play the female lead in the film adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, it has been reported.  The movie version of Dan Brown's best-selling novel is being directed by Ron Howard and also stars Tom Hanks. Tautou will play Hanks' code-cracking partner, according to various newspapers. She is currently starring in A Very Long Engagement, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet was also responsible for directing Tautou in Amelie in 2001, which launched the actress into the mainstream.  She also starred as the lead role in critically-acclaimed film Dirty Pretty Things in 2002. Oscar-winning director Ron Howard chose Tautou for the part, preferring a French actress to a big name Hollywood star. UK actress Kate Beckinsale had been widely tipped as a possibility for the role alongside Vanessa Paradis and Juliette Binoche. The thriller upon which the movie is based has sold more than 17 million copies and is centred on a global conspiracy surrounding the Holy Grail mythology. The Louvre Museum, scene of the gruesome murder at the beginning of the novel, recently gave permission for filming to take place there, showbusiness newspaper Variety reported. The $100m movie will be produced by Columbia\/Sony Pictures and is due for release on May 19, 2006 in the United States and France. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed \"chorion.\" \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \n\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \"contradictions\" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the \"Potter's Field.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\n\t\t\t\tHenry Ward Beecher\n\t\t\t\tAmerican Clergyman\n\t\t\t\tas recorded by George Seldes\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Organisers say this year's Berlin Film Festival, which opens on Thursday with period epic Man to Man, will celebrate a revitalised European cinema.  Of the 21 films in competition for the Golden and Silver Bear awards, more than half are from Europe with France particularly well represented. Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals \"a new consciousness for European films\". \"They're on an incredible winning streak,\" he told the Reuters agency. \"This isn't to say there aren't any good American films,\" he continued. \"It's just that there are more good European films.\"  However, Mr Kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the Iraq war had turned audiences against Hollywood imports. \"There is no anti-American mood,\" he said. Some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it. More than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend, among them Will Smith, Kevin Spacey and Keanu Reeves. But Mr Kosslick says more would be coming had the Academy Awards not been brought forward to 27 February. \"I'm not worried that we won't be able to fill the red carpet with stars,\" he said, though he admitted the festival may be moved to January next year to avoid a similar clash. The 10-day Berlinale runs until 20 February. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

The 27th was a short day at\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and \nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to \n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\n\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, \nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\naround it. I ask, \"What's going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\ndidn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There's\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\n\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \nthings, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.\n\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. \nI didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\no'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \ndemonstration and move slowly.\n\nMy wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \nand went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 \nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\n\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\nuneasy and said, \"No, let's stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\n\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \naggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \nfollowed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was \nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need \nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it \nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\n\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' \napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't \nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try \nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\n\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\n\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\nlor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \nhas a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of \npeople smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\n\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \nI turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, \nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \nstreet. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \nleft. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\n\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass, \nthey're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't \nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't \nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't \nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking \nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and \nhashish to put in a store window!\n\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \nwould stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, \nthe police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't \nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \nTrue, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-\nvaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people \ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \ncouldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \nSumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.\n\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\" \nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\n\nWe spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\n\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\nyou couldn't even see him.\n\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

But the Briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the Argentine. \"It's a great start to the year - just what I was looking for,\" Henman told his website. \"Over the years I've found David very difficult to play against.  \"He returns serve very well and he's deceptively effective from the baseline, so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result. \"Beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year.\" Henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. \"I'm not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn't do anything,\" said Henman. \"When I started training again it really, really seized up. As much as I enjoyed the two weeks off I don't think it's so productive.\" Federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 French Open champion Gaudio, but was content with his game. \"It was about getting used to the surface,\" he said.  \"The conditions are much quicker than Doha, my timing was OK, but I could have served better. \"All in all I'm happy with the match, and I won it - that's a good sign. Now I have a day off and hopefully play better the next match.\" Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months. \"I felt pretty good,\" said the American. \"I liked the way the match played out and, maybe excluding a few second serve returns, I felt like I was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.152455.14555@unocal.com>, stssdxb@st.unocal.com (Dorin Baru) writes:\n\n|> Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?\n|> \n|> Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.\n|> But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are \n|> camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the\n|> 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, \n|> civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. \n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n|> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a \n|> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing\n|> justifies murder.\n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n|> similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ?

{"text":" Ronan O'Gara scored all Ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over South Africa on an emotional day at Lansdowne Road.  O'Gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the Irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. Three further O'Gara penalties extended Ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. Two Percy Montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but Ireland held out to claim a famous victory. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Aware of the threat posed by the South Africans, Ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss.  Ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. Another South African infringement a minute later led to Ireland's first points - O'Gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an Irish try. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Stung by the score, the South Africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with Geordan Murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for Percy Montgomery. However, the Springboks did win a penalty a minute later which Montgomery easily slotted to cut Ireland's lead to 5-3.  Ireland got out of jail when the South Africans had a three-to-one overlap near the Irish line only to waste the chance. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O'Gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O'Gara penalty. However, Montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut Ireland's lead to five points again. Montgomery then burst through the Irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb Girvan Dempsey tackle to prevent a try. The South Africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and O'Gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.  In the 61st minute, Hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from Girvan Dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. However, a late tackle on Brian O'Driscoll enabled O'Gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended Ireland's lead to 17-6. However, two Montgomery penalties had Ireland's lead in peril again as the Springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. South Africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but Ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.

{"text":" The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene\/L machine.  It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene\/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.  The US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene\/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.  The IBM Blue Gene\/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene\/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.  Supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.  \"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene\/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is going \nto come out at 1:15 p.m.  With your indulgence, I think what we'd \nlike to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award \nfirst and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll \nmake a statement on Waco and take a couple questions.  So if we can \njust hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably \nwill work out a lot better. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've got a two-minute warning problem.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about \n1:15 p.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The teacher would walk off and then --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying \nto work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way \nthe President handled the notifications yesterday? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice \nDepartment about who would come out and discuss what had happened in \nWaco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even \nfarther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on \nthe contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As \nyou know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, \nabout 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of \nwhat she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had \nthe implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised \nno objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general \nnature about the incident.\n\t     \n\t     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the \nPresident spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief \ndiscussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was \nbefore the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why \nthere was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was \nconfusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day \nwhen they spoke.  \n\t     \n\t     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of \ndifferent levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the \nJustice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of \n\f\ntheir decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI \nbriefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  \nThe President then issued a statement after that.\n\t     \n\t     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair \namount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in \nWaco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the \nPresident say anything until we had a much better sense of what was \nactually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what \nwas happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a \nstatement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday \nevening.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At what hour was that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it \nwas after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of \nthe Holocaust Museum last night.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he went out to dinner.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to \ndinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I \ndon't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he \njust said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to \ntell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, \nthat she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try \nand get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning \nabout the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this \nafternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to \nmake at 1:15.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last \nnight, or this morning?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White \nHouse Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney \nGeneral was running the operation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that \nshe had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get \nsome sleep?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good \njob -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I mean, sleep well has implications as to \nconscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody \nfeels badly when you have a situation when --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame \nis brought up in that phraseology.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it \nhas nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered \nwas that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General \nhad to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation \nyesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best \nas she could and --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, does he think it was mishandled?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm \nwords to a friend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he think the situation was mishandled?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In retrospect?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the \nAttorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, \nI think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what \nexactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can \nto make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen \nagain, or at least we know how to handle it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How much did he know about what she was going to go \nahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --\noutlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely \nwhat action?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific \noperational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they \nhad a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of \naction.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just \ntrying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't \nminute-by-minute detail of how the operation --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, was it, \"we are going in.\"  Is it, \"we're \ngoing to use tear gas\"?  I mean, what?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go \nin and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in \nthe compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement \nout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there ever a conscious political \ndecision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President \nfrom --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in \nclose contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts \nresponsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted \nto be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as \nwe could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility \nof those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General \nhas operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts \nresponsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney \nGeneral.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, there was a report on the television today \n-- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult \nhad said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire \nand not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of \na smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my \nquestion is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that \nthis fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound \n-- every bit of evidence we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do \nthis now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible \nconsequences of either death or injury?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific \nquestions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going \nabout being made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Those are general questions and did he ask \ngenerally, why now?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you \nconsidered all of the consequences; have you considered the \nrecommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, \"why now?  \"  \nI don't know if he asked that specific question.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff \nthat's come out since then about the information provided by the \nlistening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much \nspecific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that \nthis is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the \ndecision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations \nshe was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of \nthose involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was \nbeyond that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the President's understanding why \nyesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple \nweeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may \nhave told law enforcement people something that precipitated this \naction.  Why yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I \nthink what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has \nsaid.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at \nsome danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and \nit was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that \nthe situation was not going to get any better at all.  \n\t     \n\t     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of \nthe agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that \nthese teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has \nsaid, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have \nreplacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a \nconcern over the safety.  \n\t     \n\t     All of these factors came into play.  They also \nconsidered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts \non David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to \nwhat the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best \njudgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They \ndid.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly \nunfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out \ndifferently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were \nmade at the time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, when did the President know that they were \ngoing to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe \nhe was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  \nI just don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along that point, George, can you say whether the \nplan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way \nto end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way \nto increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, \nas a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't \npresented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this \nrelevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet \nReno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that \nthey were acting on the best advice and the best information they \nhad, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there a 12-hour gap between \nconversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In \nother words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again \nuntil Clinton got back from dinner at --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was \nthere a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner \nwhen she called and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her \nlast night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last \nnight.  He just wanted to talk to her.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     what was going on?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone \nhas perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the \nother details?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than \nthe FBI reported in Waco.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what \nis going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was \nhe keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due \nrespect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, \nseveral people in the White House were in constant contact with their \ncounterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack \nMcLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  \nThat's not a --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with \nWebb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I \nbelieve Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  \nEither Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during \nthe day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed \nand fully informed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were told this morning that the President may \nhave spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you \nknow if that's true or not?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may \nhave.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance \nthat he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think \nthat the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with \n\f\nthe Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the \nAttorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a \nminute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was \nhappening at the Justice Department.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, who decided that the briefing would be done \nby the Attorney General?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you or did the White House communications staff \n-- were you ever involved with that decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-\nLehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     there was no advice from the White House at all \nabout her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction \nto the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally \nthe White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not \nhaving him appear as personally saying anything?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at \nall.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of \nthe information at hand.  The President is also making a statement \ntoday.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The \nPresident has been fully involved --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After this turned into less than a successful \noperation, the only statement from the President was what was on \npaper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to \nthe major facts in this.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement \nfrom the President, not the only statement from the President, number \none.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After the --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  \nNumber two, the Attorney General --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He gave a statement early in the morning when the \nthing was starting to move --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday \nand he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It just happens this was a written statement with \nno sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was \nthe President wants to put out a written statement?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, \nwe thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was \nappropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and \nexpressing his support for the Attorney General's --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do \nsomething?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  \nThat is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't \nsay the President took full responsibility for what happened --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, what you said was --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I \nmean, unless I miss something --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Janet Reno said that she took full \nresponsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes \nresponsibility.  Absolutely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Took responsibility -- all right.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Considering how little was known about what was \ngoing on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why \nis Washington calling this a mass suicide?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we \nknow now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and \nduring, it is painfully clear that those there were under his \ncontrol.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are \nconcerned, though, isn't it, George?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely \ndifferent matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear \nresponsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he \nclearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, \nand that's what he did.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're still operating completely on assumption, \nright?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that \nthis was mass suicide.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside \nthe compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of \nthose inside.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's \nquestion, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton \nhimself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff \non this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Right after the evening news went on the air?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the \ninformation.  We were working on it.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q \t  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the \ninvestigation the President is going to announce is going to be an \nadministration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the \noutside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a \npolitical stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have \nalready been --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and \nthe Justice Department will bear responsibility for the \ninvestigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations \nlike this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But \nit will be run by the Treasury and Justice. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you confident that you will not have any \nproblem getting --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, did the President reach out to anybody else \nto get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the \nWhite House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was \nthere at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sunday.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it \nwasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but \nbeyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you said that in that phone call, she said \nthat we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force \nhim out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know \nabout tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action \nto increase the pressure on --\n\t     \n\t     q\bQ\t   It didn't matter how she did that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What information did he have in terms of how this \nwould proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-\nby-minute, but in a general sense --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the \nrecommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the \nlaw enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is \"this\" -- when you say that \"this\" was the \nrecommendation --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I \ndon't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be \ntold that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a \nhole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they \nwere moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I \njust don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best \nadvice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general \nquestions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same \ntime -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous \nrecommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, it would seem that this question about just \nexactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of \nthe operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you \ntake that question and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     get the answer and come back to us with all of \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a \nstrategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a \nwritten statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be \non all of these television broadcasts?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And you never called the Justice Department and \nsaid to anyone or Janet Reno, \"you're the one who needs to be out \nfront explaining this\"?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It just happened that way that she was the \nspokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney \nGeneral that it was important for her as the operational officer in \ncharge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the \nquestions on this tragic incident.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She had no guidance from the White House at all?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you \ndidn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     a strategy?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she clear it?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she notify you?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened to this great detailed process you \nhave for clearing and talking to every public information officer and \nevery -- under every rock and every place in government that \nsomething as major as this could have occurred without a discussion \nbetween you and the public information people at least at the Justice \nDepartment?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the \ndecision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed \nlike a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how \nyou would handle it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You wouldn't change a thing if --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The way the White House handled any part of it -- \nfrom start to finish.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad \nquestion and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the \nreasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that \nsomething like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like \nthis and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're \ntalking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, \nthere -- wouldn't make any change at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, \nno White House people or outside media consultants came up with this \nidea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the \ncampaign.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline \nafter the draft story; watching Clinton on --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  \nYesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended \nin tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was \ninvolved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to \ndo that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of \npublic information to go out and take the questions of the press in \norder to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she \ndid a fantastic job.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows \nClinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard \nto believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about \nwhat she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm \ngoing to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's \nfairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that \nhe did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a \nminute-by-minute account of the conversation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long a conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Telephone conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever \na consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you keep saying that the President takes \nfull responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does \nthe President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is \nultimately his decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do \nwith Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a \nmilitary action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his \ngovernment.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as \nhers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her \ndecision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full \nresponsibility. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, this briefing has gone on just a little \nover 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  \nWhat exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just \nvery general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone \nconversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think \nBrit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One of the things Reno said last night is that the \nbuck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the \nPresident agree with that in this case?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full \nresponsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that \nshe made a decision, that she's going to accept all the \nresponsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that \nat all, but neither is the President. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At any point in the conversation last night between \nthe President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever \noffer her a resignation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were \nsome Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is \nthe White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests \ntrying to make political hay out of this situation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any \nquestions about the motives of those who are requesting \ninvestigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and \ncomplete investigation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  \nWill you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How \nwill you answer the question that you've taken?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you remind us what the President was \ndoing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was \ninvolved in?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He \nhad a series of meetings with different members of the staff during \n\f\nthe afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and \ngetting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as \nwell.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as \nwell.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And those reports would have come to him from Mack \nMcLarty, would they -- do you think?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to \nhim, I talked to him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, to follow Helen's question, in their \nconversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last \nnight in response to the question about whether she would resign?  \nDid he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here \nto reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at \nall?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up \nthat specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was \ndiscussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   The didn't talk at all about her kind of \nremarkable comment last night about --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And her response was, if the President wants me to, \nI will.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the \nstandard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's \na conditional statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     have a need to talk about whether -- personally \nabout whether the President wanted her --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about \nit.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was \nlargely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come \nup.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you take that with the Brit package?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, for the record, does the President want her \nto resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet \nReno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She \nhandled a difficult situation extremely well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, does the President feel that he and Janet \nReno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law \nenforcement experts on the ground?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not \nsecond-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  \nThat is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  \nEverybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best \njudgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best \ninformation we had.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on \nSunday, is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday \nmorning?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that \nquestion, too.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Were these outside experts that they were \nconsulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just \nnot sure.  I know that there were several experts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And also, why weren't there replacements for these \npeople?  Is the unit that small?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small \nhighly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things \nthat the investigation will examine.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI \nDirector?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, \ndoesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  \nBut presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout \nthis entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone \nand talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from \nhim on what to do and what not to do?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI \nDirector well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke \nout in Waco.

The\n       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine\n       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.\n\n   2) Use a different UART for your serial line.

{"text":" So-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.  The number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.  In its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.  Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. \"E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,\" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. \"In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,\" he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. \"Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,\" he said. Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. But by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The Streets, aka British rapper and songwriter, Mike Skinner have topped a poll to find the year's best album.  A Grand Don't Come for Free beat Keane's Hope and Fears in second place with Franz Ferdinand's self-titled album third, in the Q magazine poll. Skinner uses blunt beats under streetwise lyrics about such things as falling in love and drink and drugs. Q Magazine said: \"A Grand Don't Come for Free captured the country's mood in a way no one could have predicted.\" A Grand Don't Come for Free is the second album from The Streets. It followed Original Pirate Material. Q Magazine also had praise for the runners-up in the poll. Keane's Hopes and Fears, was described as a \"revelatory debut\" which showed \"they had songwriting flair to spare\". It also said Franz Ferdinand's album sounded \"natural, unforced (and) under-produced\". Rock band U2's latest album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb came fourth while Razorlight's Up All Night was in fifth place. Others notables on the list included Dizzee Rascal in at number 12 and The Zutons at 20. Estelle came in at 39, Joss Stone was 40th and Jamelia took the 44th place. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":"From: dnewcomb@whale.st.usm.edu (Donald R. Newcomb)\nSubject: Re: Some more about gun control...\n\nFirst, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \"join a well\n>organized militia.\"  And I have also stated that a militia that\n>meets once or twice a year is clearly \"well organized.\"  And this\n>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \"right\"\n>to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\n>by Hamilton. \n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\n-- \nDonald R.

{"text":" Chart-topping pop band Busted have confirmed that they plan to \"take a break\", following rumours that they were on the verge of splitting.  A statement from the band's record company Universal said frontman Charlie Simpson planned to spend some time working with his other band, Fightstar. However they said that Busted would \"reconvene in due course\". The band have had eight top three hits, including four number ones, since they first hit the charts in 2002. Their singles include What I Go To School For, Year 3000, Crashed The Wedding, You Said No, and Who's David?  The band, which also includes members Matt Jay and James Bourne, made the top ten with their self-titled debut album, as well as the follow-up, A Present For Everyone, in 2003. They won best pop act and best breakthrough act at the 2004 Brit Awards and were nominated for best British group. Most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of Thunderbirds, which was voted Record Of The Year on the ITV1 show. The band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. The trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. However, recent rumours have suggested that Simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on Fightstar. He now plans to take Fightstar on tour. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

The floppys have their own processor on their controller\nboard which handles all of these commands.\n\nThe difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are\nintelligent.

{"text":" Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.  \"At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain,\" the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live. \"Athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride.\" However, Linford Christie countered: \"It's easy to criticise when you haven't gone through the system here.\" Johnson was involved in a verbal spat with Britain's Darren Campbell earlier this year. The American had cast doubt on Campbell's claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the Olympic 100m and 200m finals.  And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting. \"The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,\" he claimed. \"Athletes here have to compete more outside the UK. Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter.\" Speaking at an elite coaches' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. \"You can't fix everything with money,\" he admitted. \"You contrast the situation here to that of some US athletes who have no funding. \"Those who aren't funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging. \"So when they get to the top they are more appreciative.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE\n\nThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:\n\n69 year old Hatin Nine telling:\n\n-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\"\nWhere are you?\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Whose \"Jesus of the Bible\" do you mean?\n\n     This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but \n     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read \n     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For \n     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\n     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)] \n     on the Deity of Christ.\n\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \n     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, \n     you have to look at the Bible.\n\nra> >     \"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The\nra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by\nra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had\nra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon\nra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).\nra>\nra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is\n     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late\n     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the\n     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I\n     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.\n\n     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may \n     certainly be.\n\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu\n","meta":{"source":"NG"}}

{"text":" Ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry.  The issue was discussed at a meeting between UK government officials, industry representatives and the British Board of Film Classification. It follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. In 2003, Britons spent \u00a31,152m on games, more than ever before. And this Christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles.  Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. His mother, Giselle, said her son's killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game.  Police investigating Stefan's murder dismissed its influence and said Manhunt was not part of its legal case. The issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on Sunday by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. This was the focus of the talks between government officials, representatives from the games industry and the British Board of Film Classification. \"Adults can make informed choices about what games to play. Children can't and they deserve to be protected,\" said Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell after the meeting. \"Industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn't play.\" Roger Bennett, director general of Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, said: \"A number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. \"They will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding, recognition and awareness of the games rating system, ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content.\"  Among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.  According to industry statistics, a majority of players are over 18, with the average age of a gamer being 29. Academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as Manhunt with violent responses in players. In a report published this week for the Video Standards Council, Dr Guy Cumberbatch said: \"The research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny.\" Dr Cumberbatch, head of the social policy think tank, the Communications Research Group, reviewed the studies on the issue. He concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.  If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9\/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9\/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (\u00a3196m) in the US alone. But this year's Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.  Fahrenheit 9\/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.  Moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore's film does not sit well with the Academy. \"If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Fahrenheit 9\/11 didn't really fit in to that category. \"They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,\" he said. While he said the Oscar voting panel were not \"snubbing\" Moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. \"I think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,\" he said.  The problem with Mel Gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.  \"Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,\" he said. But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Mr Dams said: \"It's not an inflammatory film. It has done very well in Germany, and it's a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.\" Another 'contentious' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.  Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress.  The film has been a hit around the world. Mr Dams said: \"It's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced. \"Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. It's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views. \"While in Fahrenheit 9\/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it's a very likeable film - means it's won through on charm.\" Dam's pick at this year's Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese's biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes. Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was \"our worst peformance in the Champions League\".  Kolo Toure's late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: \"The only positive is that we are still in the tie. \"The players are really down in the dressing-room. I feel we really turned in a bad performance. \"At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.\"  Goalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: \"We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.\" Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: \"But there is enough time for crying. I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. \"In this job, you have good and bad nights. This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire.\" But Wenger's Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either.

As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself. \"I just know the goals were very easy against us.

Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.

{"text":" Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.  The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.  Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.  Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.  Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The UK's adoption of digital TV and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in Europe, according a report by Jupiter Research.  But the UK still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. The most digitally sophisticated Europeans, in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles, TV, net and cameras, are the Scandinavians. About 14 million households in the UK, 60%, have digital TV, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. The least digital of the European nations was Greece, in 17th position, according to the Digital Life Index.  Scandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and Norway came out top in the report, but there were some differences in technology trends. \"The European Digital Life Index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today, but across Europe there is no single digital lifestyle,\" said Nate Elliott, Jupiter analyst. \"Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries.\"  Although there are differences between different European nations, the gap between them is closing, the report concluded. The trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (DVR), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across Europe, he added. More than six million UK households now have broadband net. By the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all UK net users will be on broadband. Cable company NTL is trialling faster ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) broadband technology using ADSL2+ which can give speeds of 18Mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1Mbps or 2Mbps. BT is set to trial the technology later in the year. Super-fast broadband will be necessary to the delivery of services such as high-definition TV (HDTV) and video-on-demand, already very popular in France and other European countries.  A separate survey by GMIPoll last week found that, globally, people's appetite for technology and gadgets continues unabated. The poll of 20,000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more technology.  The computer was the \"must-have\" gadget for most people (75%). The TV took second place (67%), while the mobile was ranked in third position with 54%. Digital cameras were the most popular choice of gadget for 2005, said the survey, with nearly 40% choosing this over wireless, home printing and DVR technologies. However, only 25% of Britons said a digital camera would be their top gadget purchase of the year. Almost a quarter, 22%, said they would be buying some sort of wireless device. Forty-four percent said they would be buying something \"other\". This might include digital music players, or gaming devices. The Nintendo DS, Sony's PSP and Gizmondo all hit the shops in 2005, and the first of the next generation of games consoles, Xbox 2, is set to launch later this year. Jupiter Research's index is calculated using 40 different variables across net users, digital TV adoption, wireless and mobile, online activity, and digital devices. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.

{"text":" The 10 authors shortlisted for a Richard and Judy book award in 2005 are hoping for a boost in sales following the success of this year's winner.  The TV couple's interest in the book world coined the term \"the Richard & Judy effect\" and created the top two best-selling paperbacks of 2004 so far. The finalists for 2005 include Andrew Taylor's The American Boy and Robbie Williams' autobiography Feel. This year's winner, Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, sold over one million. Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea came second and saw sales increase by 350%. The best read award, on Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan's Channel 4 show, is part of the British Book Awards. David Mitchell's Booker-shortlisted novel, Cloud Atlas, makes it into this year's top 10 along with several lesser known works.  \"There's no doubt that this year's selection of book club entries is the best yet. If anything, the choice is even wider than last time,\" said Madeley. \"It was very hard to follow last year's extremely successful list, but we think this year's books will do even better,\" said Richard and Judy executive producer Amanda Ross. \"We were spoiled for choice and it was tough getting down to only 10 from the 301 submitted.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" The creator of defunct TV soap Brookside has written to the culture minister to offer to buy Channel 4.

But media watchdog Ofcom has said the the commercially funded public service broadcaster will not be privatised. A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.  He added that primary legislation would be required for the station to be sold off, which the government was not intending to introduce. Brookside was axed in 2003 after its ratings slumped from a peak of seven million to just 1.5 million.

Ted Williams (includes season after war)--missed actual peak years\n 2.  Babe Ruth\n 3.  Walter Johnson\n 4.  Mickey Mantle\n 5.  Mike Schmidt  (actual peak year shortened by strike)\n 6.

{"text":" Blackburn striker Matt Jansen faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem.  But central defender Lorenzo Amoruso is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation. Rovers' assistant manager Mark Bowen said: \"Matt had a small operation to trim knee cartilage. \"It's a tiny piece of work, which should be a fairly quick recovery. Lorenzo is also jogging for the first time, along with kicking a ball.\" Jansen's career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago.  He returned to first-team action soon after Mark Hughes' appointment as Blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against Portsmouth in his first appearance of the season. Bowen added: \"I'm guessing, but I reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely.\" The Rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for Amoruso's availability for first-team duties. Bowen said: \"There's still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks. \"It's a case of see how he goes. You can't put a real time on a comeback, we'll see how he progresses.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

Any\ndiscrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the\nsole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the\ncase for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam.\nThis of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism.

If we take Russia as an example Jews were\nseriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church\nand State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew\nconverted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.)\nPeter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background.\nCan we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism\nand was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I\nsuspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief\nand AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not.

Most \n          victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually \n          during a PREVIOUS LIFE. \n          \n               What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of \n          EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in \n          a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence), \n          that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this \n          life or the next. \n          \n               Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the \n          related \"LAW of Retribution\", should read books such as \"HERE \n          AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several \n          kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including \n          HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50% accurate; the \n          subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially \n          with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by \n          young children, some of whom can identify their most recent \n          previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL \n          of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off \n          land while traveling there for the first time on vacation), \n          the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN \n          SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including \n          Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of \n          Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before \n          he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!). \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT \n          life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               People would behave much better toward each other if \n          they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be \n          reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n \n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (books like \"HERE AND \n          HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery). \n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                   Robert E.

{"text":" Microsoft is planning to make Windows and Internet Explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information.  \"Info cards\" will help people manage personal details on their PCs to make online services safer, said Microsoft. Microsoft's two previous programs, Passport and Hailstorm, aimed to protect users but were criticised. ID fraud is one of the UK's fastest-growing crimes, with criminals netting an estimated \u00a31.3bn last year. A quarter of UK adults has either had their ID stolen, via hi-tech or other means, or knows someone who has, a recent report by Which? magazine found.  Microsoft is developing a new version of Internet Explorer browser and its operating system, Windows, which has been code-named Longhorn. Michael Stephenson, director in Microsoft's Windows Server division, would not confirm however whether the new info cards ID system will be built into the current Windows XP version or Longhorn.  \"We're trying to make the end-user experience as simple as possible,\" Mr Stephenson said. The system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure, said Microsoft. While Passport and Hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net, the latest system will store data on a user's PC. \"It's going to put control of digital IDs into the hands of an end-user, the end-user will be in full control,\" said Mr Stephenson.  Hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company. Passport provides a single log-in for more than one website and stores basic personal information. But its popularity suffered after security scares. Up to 200 million Passport accounts were left vulnerable to online theft and malicious hackers after a flaw in the system was exploited in 2003. Online auction site, eBay, stopped supporting it in January 2005. Although the flaw was fixed, Microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in Internet Explorer. Last year, it released a major security update for Windows, Service Pack 2, to combat some of the security concerns. Longhorn is due to be released commercially in late 2006, but an updated version of Internet Explorer is due for release later this year. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will not face any Football Association action over the comments he made after their Carling Cup tie with Manchester United.  Mourinho intimated that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson influenced referee Neale Barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. But an FA spokesman told BBC Sport: \"We are not taking action over Mourinho. \"We have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. That is the end of it.\" Mourinho was concerned that Ferguson's conversation with Barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official. \"I see one referee in the first half and another in the second,\" said Mourinho. \"If the FA ask me what happened, I will tell them. What I saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things.  \"Maybe when I turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody I will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit. \"The referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. It was fault after fault, dive after dive. \"But I know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. He should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him, but there was also someone else.\" Referees chief Keith Hackett believes Mourinho should retract his comments about Ferguson and Barry as he believes the Blues boss has questioned their integrity. \"I'm hoping he might reconsider his comments, unfortunately this is the nature of the game,\" said Hackett. \"I don't want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. For the second leg we have an experienced referee, and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing. \"Sometimes managers have grounds for comments, and I note that, but a referees integrity has been questioned, that is offensive and should be avoided. Mr Mourinho should look at the facts.\" Mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final. \"It's 0-0, so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time,\" he said. \"We have exactly the same chance we had before this game. \"We are confident of getting a result but we know what Manchester United is, a footballing power. It'll be difficult for us, but also for them.\" ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.  The latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"  Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.  The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

{"text":" Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of The Hobbit.  The Oscar winner said on a visit to Sydney there was a \"desire\" to make it, but not before lengthy negotiations. \"I think it's gonna be a lot of lawyers sitting in a room trying to thrash out a deal before it will ever happen,\" said the New Zealander. The rights to JRR Tolkien's book are split between two major film studios. Jackson, who is currently filming a remake of Hollywood classic King Kong, said he thought that the sale of MGM studios to the Sony Corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project. The 43-year-old was in the Australian city to visit a Lord of the Rings exhibition, which has attracted 140,000 visitors since it opened in December.  The film-maker recently sued film company New Line Cinema for undisclosed damages over alleged withheld profits and lost revenue from the first part of the Middle Earth trilogy. The Fellowship of The Ring from 2001 went on to make worldwide profits of $291 million (\u00a3152 million). Jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake King Kong, which is currently in production in Wellington. The picture, which stars Naomi Watts and Oscar winner Adrien Brody, is due to be released in December. Jackson has also committed to making a film version of Lovely Bones, based on the best-selling book by Alice Sebold. ","meta":{"source":"BBC"}}

You mean you were opposed to US intervention in\nSomalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world,\nthe desire to help Somalia is racist?
